He did not make any specific projections for the company'searnings this year but he said the firm will pay a dividend ofnot less than 32.5 cents per share after a proposedfour-for-one stock split and a one-for-four bonus issue.    It paid total dividends of 1.30 dlrs per share last year,equal to 26 cents per share, adjusting for the bonus and sharesplit.    Hutchison, which has operations ranging from trading toproperty and container terminals, earlier reported after-taxprofits of 1.62 billion dlrs against 1.19 billion dlrs in 1985.    The 1986 total excluded extraordinary gains of 563 mlndlrs, partly from the sale of some of its stake in the SouthChina Morning Post, the leading English language newspaper,compared with 369 mln dlrs the previous year. It said itexpects another 277 mln dlr gain in 1987 from the sale of theremaining shares.    Li said Hong Kong's property market remains strong whileits economy is performing better than forecast with its largelyexport-led growth.    Gross domestic product grew by nearly nine pct last yearagainst an initial government projection of 4.5 pct.    But he said Hong Kong's large trade deficit with the U.S.May result in protectionist measures that will adversely affectthe British colony.    He said all of the company's major operations showedimproved results in 1986.    Hutchison said earlier it will sell its entire 23.5 pctinterest in Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd <HKEH.HK> to<Cavendish International Holdings Ltd>, itself a spin-off fromHongkong Electric.

In a joint statement, American Express and Shearson saidthe actions under consideration are an integral part ofAmerican Express' worldwide financial services strategy andthat the two companies have been having both internal andexternal discussions on the matters.    American Express said no decision has been reached on thestrategic options and that it and Shearson could ultimatelydecide to follow growth plans already in place.    Last week, rumors circulated on Wall Street that thefinancial services giant was considering a spinoff of part ofShearson and there was speculation it may be consideringselling a stake to a Japanese firm. Analysts said thespeculation also focused on American Express selling 20 pct ofthe profitable brokerage firm to the public.    There was some speculation that American Express had alsoconsidered a total spinoff of Shearson, but the plan wasconsidered highly unlikely, analysts said.     American Express said in the statement on Sunday that itwill not comment on rumors and speculation and a spokesmanwould not go beyond the statement. The company also remainedsilent last Thursday and Friday, as rumors drove AmericanExpress stock up a total of 5-1/2 dlrs in two days to bring itto a Friday close at 74.     It said it issued the statement on Sunday because asimilar statement was being circulated to employees.    Analysts have been divided on whether it makes sense forAmerican Express to give up a stake in the wholly-ownedbrokerage, which improved its after-tax earnings by about 50pct in the last year.    Some analysts said American Express may consider spinningoff part of Shearson because it is concerned that its stockprice does not fully reflect the value of the brokerage firm.     Shearson contributed 316 mln dlrs of American Express'1.25 billion dlr net in 1986.    American Express' ambitious plans for international growthmay be also enhanced by the added cash that spinning out partof Shearson would bring. Analysts speculated that all ofShearson would have a market value of about 3.5 billion dlrs.

Preussag hasfrequently said its results came under further pressure in 1986following a difficult year in 1985.    Managing board chairman Guenther Sassmannshausen said inDecember the board would prefer to stick to its policy of notdipping into reserves to pay dividends. The spokesman noted thefinal dividend decision rests with the supervisory board.    The Preussag statement said results fell in 1986 comparedwith 1985 because declines in earnings in metals, oil andshipping were not entirely compensated by positive trends inthe group's other divisions.    The spokesman said it was not clear whether the domesticgroup would show a net profit in 1986, adding this would dependpartly on the level of provisions.    Preussag cut its 1985 dividend to eight marks from ninemarks on 1984 results after parent company net profit droppedto 65.0 mln marks from 103.0 mln the year before.    The Preussag world group made a net loss of 13.1 mln marksin 1985 after a net profit of 154.5 mln the year before.Domestic group net profit fell to 77.9 mln from 122.2 mln.    The statement said its results in 1986 were affected byunsatisfactory selling prices for metals and oil as well as bypoor use of capacity in the supply ship sector.    The reduction in natural gas prices in the fourth quarterof 1986 to reflect earlier falls in oil prices was anadditional factor behind the drop in results.    Preussag said rationalization measures already introducedwould not begin to take full effect until this year.    Preussag's domestic group turnover rose to 4.48 billionmarks in 1986 from 4.29 billion in 1985, helped by the firsttime consolidation of 951.8 mln marks of turnover from itsmajority-owned oil and gas subsidiary C. Deilmann AG.    Domestic group turnover in the 1986 fourth quarter alonewas 1.1 billion marks, it said without giving comparisonfigures.    Preussag said its domestic crude oil production fell 4.0pct to 94,400 tonnes in 1986, while foreign oil production roseto 182,900 tonnes from 174,500 tonnes.    Preussag said its Amalgamated Metal Corporation Plc (AMC)subsidiary, whose results are included in the world groupaccounts, made an unspecified profit in the fourth quarter oflast year.    AMC's large losses in 1985, caused principally by theinternational tin crisis, were the reason behind the worldgroup losses that year. REUTER",0,23

Johnson and Johnson said the sweetner is being jointlydeveloped with Tate and Lyle PLC <TATL>.    Tate and Lyle is seeking approval in Canada, the UnitedKingdom and other European countries, Johnson and Johnson said.The company noted its petition covering the product and itssafety evaluation were submitted to the FDA last month.

Patents and licensing agreements control the use ofsucralose through the year 2001, Johnson and Johnson said.

"earn,","uk,",BRITISH TELECOM CAUTIOUS ON EARNINGS PROSPECTS,"British Telecommunications Plc's <BTY.L>profit growth prospects for the coming years will be reduced byincreasing competition and continued costs for replacing oldtelephone systems, deputy chairman Graeme Odgers said.    Speaking at a news conference on the third quarter resultswhich were released earlier today, Odgers said the companyfaced heavy costs for installing new digital telephone systemsin Britain for three to five years.    He said <Mercury Communications Ltd>, a Cable and WirelessPlc <CAWL.L> subsidiary, was becoming a significant competitor.    Odgers said Mercury was seeking to make inroads into someof British Telecom's most profitable areas.    One company official privately estimated that BritishTelecom still had a 99 pct share of the U.K. Telecommunicationsmarket but feared that this could slip to 95 or 90 pct.    The recent two-and-a-half-week engineering strike, whichlead to some disruption in service, could well have encouragedclients to consider using the Mercury system, Odgers said.    However, he forecast that the last quarter's resultsoverall should not be adversely affected by the walkout.    He calculated salary savings as a result of the strike at50 mln stg and while loss of income on telephone calls shouldbe limited revenue probably dropped on peripheral activities.    But on balance Odgers said that group's financial strength,economies of scale and the fact that it operates in a growthindustry will help produce annual profit increases for theforseeable future.    British Telecom will also seek to expand intomanufacturing, he said, adding that research and developmentexpenditure will rise both in terms of value and compared withthe current proportion of two pct of overall turnover.    Analysts said the company's downbeat forecasts helpedshares dip to 242p in mid-afternoon, down 4p from yesterday'sclose and off an early high of 248p.    Philip Augar of stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co Ltd saidthe market expects slower profit growth, but forecast a sevento eight pct rise in both earnings per share and pretax profitover the next two years. In the 1985/86 financial year, pre-taxprofit rose to 1.81 billion stg from 1.48 billion.    Augar noted that a government-imposed formula linkingcharges to inflation meant that the company's scope for raisingprices was limited as long as inflation remains low. Reuter",0,21

The director of the Banco do Brasil's foreign tradedepartment (CACEX), Roberto Fendt, told reporters the upturn inFebruary confirmed a rising trend in exports, which totalled1.53 billion dlrs against 1.26 billion in January and, afterexcluding coffee and oil derivitives, was only slightly belowthe same month last year.    Coffee earnings were down to 110 mln dlrs against 295 mlnin February 1986 because of lower prices, he added.    Fendt said that although the February results were lowerthan the average expected for the rest of the year, thegovernment's target of an eight-billion-dlr surplus for 1987should be achieved. This would compare with a 1986 surplus of9.5 billion dlrs.    Exports this year are expected to total 22.5 billion dlrsand imports 14.5 billion, he added. In 1986 exports totalled22.4 billion dlrs and imports 12.9 billion.    Fendt said the rise in imports in February to 1.27 billiondlrs from 1.12 billion in February last year was in line withgovernment plans to foster economic growth.    Fendt said that imports were running at levels well abovethe traditional average for Brazil.    In the first two months of the year imports, excluding oiland wheat totalled, 1.8 billion dlrs against 1.47 billion inthe same 1986 period.    This rise in import demand reflected the needs of Brazilianindustry to equip to raise production and is perfectlycompatible with the government's program for economic growth,Fendt added.

Earlier, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson announcedin his annual budget to Parliament that from today, companieswill be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifyingdevelopment expenditure on certain future oil fields againstPetroleum Revenue Tax (PRT).    To date, full relief was allowed for expenditure on anindividual field itself, when its income stream began, but wasnot immediately available against other developmentexpenditure, the statement said.    The new relief will apply to fields outside the southernbasin for which developmentconsent is first given on or after today, and will improve thepost-tax economics of new developments and encourage companiesto proceed with project which might have been delayed, it said.    Lawson also announced that he would henceforth allowcertain expenditure on oil related research which does not atpresent qualify for PRT relief to be offset against PRTliability.    This means oil-related expenditure in the U.K. Or on theU.K. Continental shelf, which has not become allowable in aparticular field within three years of being incurred, to beallowed against PRT liability in any oil field, the InlandRevenue said.    This brings the scope of PRT relief for research costs morein line with corporation tax relief measures, and is planned toencourage general research into ways of reducing fielddevelopment costs, it said.    In due course, the industry should benefit by over 100 mlnstg a year, it calculated.    The Inland Revenue statement also included other technicalmeasures that Lawson did not comment on in his budget speech.    These included measures to allow companies to balance theirshares of PRT-exempt oil allowances through reallocation in twopast periods of allowance utilisation.    Tidier rules on incorrectly allowed PRT expenditure reliefswere announced, while there were also ammendments on rules oncorporation tax and Advance Corporation Tax relating to theso-called ring fence"" of activities in the U.K. And itscontinental shelf.

"crude,","uk,",U.K. OIL REVENUE FORECAST TO FALL IN 1987/88,"The U.K. Government forecasts that oilrevenues will fall to four billion stg in the fiscal year1987/88, from 4.75 billion in 1986/87 and 11.5 billion in1985/86.    The forecast came in the Treasury's Financial Statement andBudget Report issued after the Chancellor of the ExchequerNigel Lawson's annual budget statement to parliament.    The government is assuming the price of oil will average 15dlrs a barrel, in line with its earlier forecasts, and its oilrevenue calculation is based on an exchange rate remainingclose to current levels, the Treasury document said.    The Treasury said the 1987/88 oil revenue shortfall willreflect the oil price fall of 1986, as North Sea corporationtax is paid after a time lag.    The statement calculated that a one dlr a barrel differencein oil prices this year will change revenue by about 350 mlnstg for the current fiscal year, and 400 mln stg in a fullyear.    Oil production is forecast to fall slightly in 1987,according to the statement. A change in one mln tonnes inproduction would alter revenue by about 45 mln stg in 1987/88and 50 mln stg in a full year, it added.    Total general government receipts for 1986/87 are nowestimated to be 159.2 billion stg, 2.75 billion more than the1986 Budget forecasts and above the Autumn Statement forecasts,despite a shortfall of 1.25 billlion in oil receipts.    Additional non-North Sea corporation tax of 1.75 billionstg and VAT of 750 mln stg account for the bulk of theovershoot.    Total general government receipts were forecast to rise to168.8 billion stg in fiscal 1987/88, and among the main items,besides diminishing oil revenues, were projected income tax of40 billion stg, up from 38.4 billion in the current year.    Non-North Sea corporation tax is forecast to bring in 13.5billion stg in 1987/88, after the revised 11.2 billion in1986/87, and VAT revenue should amount to 23.3 billion,compared with upwardly revised estimated 21.5 billion thisfiscal year.    The general government expenditure for the coming fiscalyear is expected to total 173.5 billion stg, up from a revised164.9 billion in the current year.    A repayment of 800 mln on public corporations' market andoverseas borrowings is forecast to bring the total PublicSector Borrowing Requirement down to 3.9 billion stg in1987/88, from this year's revised 4.1 billion, the Treasurysaid.

Sony will have an irregular five-month business term endingMarch 31, as its financial year will be changed to run fromApril 1 to March 31 from the current October 31 year end.    Group sales in the same period are estimated at about 550billion yen, down five pct from a year earlier, he said.    The company earlier reported net income of 7.65 billion yenin the three month period ended January 31, down 59.2 pct froma year earlier, on sales of 343.06 billion, down 6.3 pct.    The gloomy profits and sales resulted from the yen's recentappreciation against the dollar and a sharp drop in marketprices due to severe sales competition at home and abroad.    The yen rose 26 pct to an average of 159 yen to the dollar,reducing the company's total sales in the three month period by40 billion yen, Hashimoto said.    Sales of 8-mm video camera/recorders totalled 300,000 unitsin the three months, unchanged from a year earlier, whileBeta-format video tape recorders (vtrs) sales fell to 300,000from 350,000. Sales of compact disc players rose to 450,000from 300,000 and those of the Walkman rose to 2.25 mln from1.30 mln but colour television sales fell to 950,000 from onemln due to lower exports to China.    Sales of 8-mm vtrs had already exceeded Beta-format vtrssales since the beginning of fiscal 1986, Hashimoto said.Overseas sales accounted for 68.2 pct of the total in the threemonths compared with 71.3 pct a year earlier.    Overseas production will account for 35 pct of its totalproduction in 1990 from the present 20 pct.

"ship,","japan,",ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN SHIPBUILDERS RECOVERY,"Japan's ailing shipbuilding industryplans to refloat itself in a few years from the twin rocks ofrecession and a strong yen through capacity and workforce cutsand greater use of computers, industry sources told Reuters.    The salvage measures, which include a government-sponsoredrationalisation program, are aimed at clawing back some of themarket which Japan, the world leader, has lost to South Koreathrough currency and labour cost disadvantages, they said.    The sources said South Korea's yards are now some 35 pctmore competitive than Japan's due to such factors.    The government plans to help the industry shed 20 pct ofcurrent capacity within two years through mergers andregrouping under legislation put before Parliament this monthand likely to be approved by May or June, the sources said.    They said from September a semi-government body will assurerepayment of about 50 billion yen in liabilities incurredthrough job losses and the sale of excess capacity, and another30 billion for buying unneeded land and equipment.    Last Friday, the Shipbuilders Association of Japan appliedto the Fair Trade Commission to form a cartel to slash tonnagebuilt to about half of total capacity for a year from April 1.    The commission has held several hearings with the industryand approval should be given this month, the sources said.    A clampdown on output over one or two years combined with aplanned cost-cutting and streamlining program and state supportshould help Japanese yards recover their internationalcompetitiveness, they said.    Under the cartel proposals, 33 yards each capable ofbuilding ships of more than 10,000 gross tonnes would build amaximum of three mln compensated gross registered tonnes (CGRT)in 1987/88. This is about half of total capacity.    This will ease the cut-throat competition which forced mostyards to sign orders below cost, the sources said.    The industry is likely to seek to renew the cartel for1988/89 as the Transport Ministry sees new orders falling to3.1 mln CGRT in 1988/89 from 3.3 mln in 1987/88, they said.    The rationalisation program includes a cut of 20,000 to30,000 of the estimated 100,000 workers in the industry between1986 and 1989.    Japanese yards topped world order books at end-December,followed by South Korea and Taiwan, according to Lloyd'sRegister of Shipping.    However, falling orders and declining internationalcompetitiveness due to the strong yen led to heavy losses inthe industry, the sources said.    Four of Japan's six major heavy machinery and shipbuildingcompanies reported current deficits in the first half of theyear to March 31 and five of them are expected to reportcurrent deficits for the whole of 1986/7, they said.    The shipbuilding companies' streamlining program will raiseproductivity to compete with South Korean yards which have alsobeen hard hit by declining orders and low ship prices in recntyears, the sources said.    In Japan, no single yard leads the industry, resulting infierce competition and slow progress in reducing capacity. Thetwo largest firms -- Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd <MITH.T>and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co Ltd <JIMA.T> --account for only 30 pct of ships built, the sources said.    World shipowners hope Japanese yards can manage to ride outthe recession as their technology is the best in the world",5,15

It said the Bundesbank could hold them down despite strongforeign influence and it saw no interest-straining factors inthe economy that could affect the long-term capital market.    The inflation rate of one pct also gave no occasion forhigher nominal interest rates. But a probable rise in inflationlate this year could give very slight grounds for a rise innominal rates at year's end and next year, it said.    The association said generally low interest rates,prospects of lower taxes, a stable dollar rate and expectedstrong domestic demand led it to believe that the investmentclimate would remain friendly and the economy would continueits slow but very sure growth.    The Bundesbank had managed successfully to keep interestrates down on the short-term money market although its policieshad exerted little effect on the long-term capital market,which was so important for investment financing and thus forthe course of the economy, it said.    In view of the limits to the possibilities monetary policyhad in influencing the longer-term capital market, theassociation saw little sense in wanting to boost the economythrough a short-term and expansionist monetary policy.    On the other hand it also saw no reason for stickingdogmatically to the money supply target for the whole of 1987.

"money-supply,","west-germany,",GERMAN MONEY SUPPLY GROWTH SLOWS IN FEBRUARY,"West Germany's money supply growthslowed in February after January's sharp rise but the trend isstill definitely upward, the Bundesbank said in a statement.    Growth in the traditionally broad M3 aggregate was onlymoderate in February. While cash in circulation, deposits withstatutory withdrawal notice and sight deposits grew sharply,short-term time deposits fell after expanding unusuallystrongly in January.    In the six months to February, M3, which excludes holdingsof German non-banks abroad, grew at a seasonally adjustedannual rate of 8.5 pct after 9.8 in the six months to January.    Compared with February 1986, M3 rose 7-1/2 pct.    In the six months to February, M2, which excludes timedeposits with statutory withdrawal notice, rose at a seasonallyadjusted annual rate of 8.8 pct and M1, which consists of cashand sight deposits, rose seven pct.    International transactions of non-banks again led to asignificant inflow of funds, the Bundesbank said.    Net claims of commercial banks and the Bundesbank againstforeigners, refecting these foreign payments, increased by 9.1billion marks in February, little changed from January's rise.    But in contrast to January, the dampening effect of theinflow on domestic credit demand outweighed the expansionaryeffect on money growth, the Bundesbank said.    Outstanding bank credits to companies and privateindividuals remained virtually unchanged in February.    A sharp drop in short-term company credits, which reflectedthe foreign funds inflow, was balanced by a moderate rise inlong-term credits and a sharp rise in credits for securities.    At the end of February total bank credits to the privatesector were 4-1/2 pct above the February 1986 level.    The effect of public authority cash movements on the moneysupply was slightly expansive, the Bundesbank said.    Although banks acquired large amounts of public authoritypaper, public authorities drew down book credits at commercialbanks and the Bundesbank.    Capital formation strengthened in February and slowed moneysupply growth to a larger extent than in January.    A total of 7.7 billion marks in long-term funds was placedwith banks after 6.6 billion the previous month. REUTER",4,23

The offer would be made on the basis of 29 new Williamsshares for every 50 in Norcros, or 432.7p a share    Norcros shares firmed to 410p at 0914 GMT from a close lastnight of 397p.    A statement by Williams said it was confident of the meritsof the proposed merger and it had therefore taken care topropose from the outset the right terms, including a full cashalternative.    The offer will include a partial convertible alternativeunder which shareholders would receive up to a total of 205.69mln new second convertible shares in Williams instead of theirordinary share allocations.    The offer for Norcros preferential shares offers oneWilliams preferential share for each one of Norcros, for avalue of 130p each and a total of 2.9 mln stg.    Last week Williams reported that pretax profits for 1986rose to 22.9 mln stg from 6.3 mln.    Speculation about a bid for Norcros had been circulating inthe market for several months, dealers said. Initially itcentred on <Bunzl Plc>, which once held a 2.6 pct stake, thenswitched to Williams when it began accumulating shares.    Earlier this year, Williams suggested holding talks withNorcros on a possible merger but was rebuffed by Norcros whichreplied that any benefits that could be achieved could alsoresult from normal trading.

The council said in a statement the industry was bitterlydisappointed by the Australian government's position ontaxation, as presented in a speech by Resources and EnergyMinister Gareth Evans to the APEA conference.    As earlier reported, Evans said he was inclined to targetany tax changes rather than take a broad-based approach tosecondary taxation of petroleum.    APEA had expected the government to make positive responsesto detailed industry submissions seeking the removal ofexisting secondary tax disincentives to exploration anddevelopment, the council said.    It said it plans to reply in detail to issues raised byEvans, but its immediate concern was the decision to proceedwith the current resource rental tax (RRT) legislation.    Evans told the conference the government did not plan toaccept industry pleas for changes in the legislation to allowdeductibility of unsuccessful exploration expenditure.    The government's unwillingness to allow the deduction ofunsuccessful exploration expenditure within the whole offshorearea in which RRT applies negates any claim that the tax isprofit based",6,26

General manager Liu Shuxun declined to give a 1987 profitforecast, saying targets were under study.    Assistant general manager Wang Hongshan said the group'soutstanding loans at end-1986 totalled 620 mln Hong Kong dlrs,up from 530 mln at end-1985. Deposits and interbank borrowingsrose to 680 mln dlrs from 550 mln, he told Reuters.    Liu said most of the group's profit came from the parentcompany rather than its two wholly-owned subsidiaries <XiamenInternational Finance Co Ltd> in Hong Kong and <LusoInternational Bank Ltd> in Macao.    The joint venture bank began operating in September 1985but did not officially open until March 1986.    Liu said the share in the joint venture of the foreignpartner, Hong Kong-listed <Panin Holdings Ltd>, had been cutlast year to 49 pct from 60 pct. This was done because foreignbanks felt the XIB's reputation would be improved if the threeChinese partners collectively held a majority stake, he said.    Liu said news reports about problems concerning Panin wereunfounded, but he did not elaborate. Panin Holdings reported aloss of 1.99 mln Hong Kong dlrs in 1986 after a net profit of268,000 dlrs in 1985.    The Chinese partners are Industrial and Commercial Bank ofChina, Fujian branch, whose share rose to 23.5 pct from 15,Fujian Investment and Enterprise Corporation 17.5 pct (15) andXiamen Construction and Development Corporation 10 pct (10).    One foreign banker said Xiamen International Bank faced thesame problems as foreign bank branches in trying to compete onunequal terms with state-owned banks.    The foreign banking market in Xiamen is thin and almostsaturated, he added.    Officials of the joint venture bank said they benefittedfrom contacts made through its three Chinese partners. But theforeign banker, who asked not to be named, said it facedinternal competition from the Industrial and Commercial Bank.    Apart from Xiamen International Bank and the InternationalAgricultural Development Bank planned by the World Bank and thestate-owned Agricultural Bank of China, Xiamen has eightforeign bank branches or representative offices, mostly of HongKong or overseas Chinese banks.

The company, which gave no 1986 profit figures, posted adomestic group net profit of 41 mln marks in 1985.    It said the 1986 profit was made possible through a 40 mlnmark write-back of reserves that had been created to coverpossible price rises. These reserves were no longer necessarybecause of recent declines in raw material prices.    Kloeckner attributed the profit decline to the fall inprices as well as the lower value of the dollar.    It said it would pay an unchanged dividend on its ordinaryshare capital, which is entirely in private hands and heldlargely by family foundations.

Despite these figures, which reflected the dollar'sweakness against the mark and oil and raw materials pricefalls, it said 1986 was a satisfactory year.    The reason was the continued expansion of the machinery andplant sector, which accounted for 42 pct of total sales.

But total operating and extraordinary profits, includingearnings from currency and securities trading on the bank's ownaccount and earnings from the sale of holdings in other firms,were more than double the previous year's level, AMB said.    BfG's 1986 accounts were included in a prospectus for AMB'scapital increase, which is to finance the insurance company'sacquisition of 50 pct plus one share of BfG.    Despite the fall in partial operating profits, BfG paid anunchanged 20 mln marks into open reserves and transferred anunchanged 80 mln marks to its trade union holding company,<Beteiligungsgesellschaft fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG>, from whichAMB has acquired the majority stake.    The bank has said its business last year suffered from theturbulence around the troubled trade-union-owned housingconcern Neue Heimat.    AMB said the 500 mln mark drop in BfG's business volume to50.1 billion marks affected the interest surplus.    The interest surplus, which fell to 897.9 mln marks from981.1 mln, was also depressed by the 0.1 point fall in theinterest margin to 1.9 pct.    A rise in the surplus on commission to 208.8 mln marks from188.1 mln was not enough to compensate for this.    The rise in total operating profits enabled BfG to step uprisk provisions, with country risks particularly emphasisedbecause of the continuing difficulties of some countries.    Disclosed risk provisions, which under West Germanaccounting rules do not necessarily reflect the full amount,rose to 736.3 mln marks from 224.0 mln.    BfG's parent credit volume eased to 32.63 billion marks in1986 from 33.51 billion. Foreign debtors accounted for 24 pctof this credit volume, and Latin American debtors accounted for14.7 pct of total lending to foreigners.    BfG posted extraordinary earnings from the sale of 25.01pct of <Volksfuersorge Deutsche Lebensversicherung AG>, 74.9pct of <BSV Bank fuer Sparanlagen und Vermoegensbildung AG> andfive pct of <Allgemeine Hypothekenbank AG>. The sale was linkedto AMB's acquisition of a majority of BfG.    These sales show up as 494.2 mln marks from profit transferagreements and 326.5 mln from writing back risk provisions. REUTER",0,23

They said this was despite the fact that the commissionaccepted over 785,000 tonnes of sugar into interventionyesterday from traders protesting that rebates are being settoo low.    The maximum rebate at yesterday's tender was 46.864 Ecusper 100 kilos, up from 45.678 Ecus the previous week.    London traders said yesterday the rebate was the largestever granted. The commission sources said today the increasewas entirely explained by world market conditions. The amountby which the rebate fell short of what producers claim isneeded to obtain an equivalent price to that for sales intointervention remained at 0.87 Ecus per 100 kilos, they said.    Operators offered a total of 854,000 tonnes of sugar intointervention last month to protest at rebates which they saidwere too low. The sources said about 706,470 tonnes of Frenchsugar and 79,000 tonnes of German sugar had been accepted, theremainder being rejected as of too low quality.    The sources noted the operators could withdraw their offersin the five week period between the acceptance of the sugar andpayment for it.    They said they saw no sign of planned withdrawals as yet,adding that they would expect operators to wait another week ortwo to review commission policy before making up their minds.

The company also said it intends to reduce its secondquarter common stock dividend to 35 cts a share from 69 cts.    Mellon said it will make a provision for loan losses in thefirst quarter of 175 mln dlrs, reflecting about 95 mln dlrs incharge-offs and 80 mln dlrs in additions to the loan-lossreserve.    It will also put 310 mln dlrs in Brazilian loans on a cashbasis, resulting in interest reversals of 10 mln dlrs.    In the first quarter of 1986, Mellon earned 60.4 mln dlrsor 2.13 dlrs a share.    Chairman David Barnes said the loan charge-offs andincreased provisions address four areas of concern in thebank's wholesale lending portfolio - the energy sector,developing countries, some basic industrial companies andseveral commercial real estate businesses.    Mellon said the loan loss reserve at the end of the firstquarter is estimated to be 575 mln dlrs, or about 2.5 pct ofthe loan book, compared with 493.8 mln dlrs or 2.17 pct oftotal loans at the end of 1986.    Mellon said its primary capital ratio at the end of thefirst quarter will be in line with the end-1986 figure of 7.23pct, well in excess of regulatory guidelines.    Non-performing loans at quarter-end are estimated at 1.45billion dlrs, or 6.5 pct of the loan portfolio, compared with928 mln dlrs or 3.94 pct at the end of 1986.    Barnes noted that Mellon has a bigger involvement inenergy-based lending than many other banks. Because of the lackof a substantial recovery in energy prices this year,especially in natural gas prices, it was felt prudent toincrease reserves and take losses on loans in this sector.

Oil use in the 24 countries of the OECD increased by aroundone pct in first quarter 1987 to 35.9 mln bpd, the IEA said inits Monthly Oil Market Report.    Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily fromtransport fuels, as in 1986. But if average consumer prices arehigher than 1986, the rate of growth for these fuels may bebelow last year's 3.6 pct, it said.    The IEA said that assuming crude oil and product pricesstay close to current levels, some destocking by end-users canbe expected. If that happens, natural gas will also regain someof the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986, and theremay be slightly less growth in transport fuels.    IEA estimates on April 1 put oil stocks in the OECD area at428 mln tonnes, representing 98 days of forward consumption.This is about the same level as at the begining of the year.    The agency said this flat trend is explained by theprojected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter ofthe year which offset a reduction in stocks.    It said initial estimates indicate that company stocks fellby 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first quarter of theyear. This followed a small rise in January of 0.4 mln bpd buta decline of 1.5 mln bpd in February and 2.5 mln bpd in March.    It is possible that final data will show a larger draw,particulary for March, it said. As crude production also fell,there is likely to have also been a decline in non-reportedstocks, particularly at sea, the IEA said.    Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonneson April 1 against 316 mln on April 1 1986. Governments builtup strategic stocks to 102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in theperiod.    The year-on-year trend of government stock building iscontinuing with year-on-year company stocks also rising, moreor less in line with consumption, after declining for fiveyears, the IEA noted.    Oil stocks on land in the U.S. And Canada were put at 206.6mln tonnes on April 1, down from the 214 mln tonnes on January1 and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption,respectively.    Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes on April1, down from the 154 mln on January 1 but still equivalent to94 days of consumption.    World oil supply fell in the first quarter by about two mlnbpd to 45.2 mln bpd from 47.2 mln bpd in last quarter 1986.    This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crudeproduction to around 15.5 mln bpd in February/March from 16.5mln bpd in January and to the seasonal drop in exports fromcentrally-planned Economies, the IEA said.    Total OPEC crude oil supply was 15.8 mln bpd in the firstquarter, plus 1.4 mln bpd of NGLs, compared with 17.3 mln bpdof crude in the last three months of 1986 and 17.9 mln averagefor the whole of 1986. Supply from non-OPEC countries totalled28 mln bpd, against 28.5 mln bpd in the fourth quarter 1986.    A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast3.3 mln bpd in March from 3.6 mln bpd in February was thelargest factor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEAsaid.

Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler said in a speech thatmonetary growth resulting from speculative capital inflowsrequired cuts in interest rates.    Separately, West Berlin state central bank president DieterHiss told journalists that the discount rate could fall belowits lowest ever point of 2.75 pct. He made clear that he wasnot making a forecast on interest rates, however.    Currency dealers here and in the Far East said the dollargained slight background support from the speculation.    But German dealers noted that the Bundesbank kept the 3.80pct rate unchanged at which it offered liquidity to the moneymarket this week, dashing some expectations that it may eitheroffer lower fixed rate money or offer a reduced minimum rateand let the strength of banks' demands set the allocation rate.    It allocated 6.1 billion marks in new liquidity, much lessthan the 14.9 billion leaving the market as a prior pactexpired. This further weakened sentiment the Bundesbank couldmove to a more accommodative monetary stance, dealers said.

"gnp,","usa,",GLOBAL ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN RAISES NEW DEBT FEARS,"The global economy is expected toweaken this year, adding new worries to an already seriouspoverty outlook, economic analysts said.    For finance ministers and central bankers attending thisweek's semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary Fundand World Bank, the new figures released by the IMF add anadditional concern.    The Fund estimated world output would only grow by 2.7 pctthis year, versus 2.9 pct last year, and 3.1 pct in 1985.    In the industrial countries, Gross National Product, ameasure of all goods and services, was expected to decline to2.3 pct this year, compared with 2.4 pct in 1986, the IMF said.    For the developing countries, the Gross Domestic Product,another measure of economic growth, was expected to fall to 3.0pct from 3.5 pct last year.    The new figures are considered a major disappointment tothe poorest countries. They had hoped that new vitality in theindustrial countries brought on by a sharp decline in oilprices would assist their economic recovery and help them copewith growing mounds of debt.    IMF officials, discussing their outlook, said they believedthe industrial country economies would move up to an annualgrowth rate of three pct by the end of the decade.    Economic analysts and the IMF have been saying for sometime that the ability to keep the debt crisis from turning intoan economic rout rests on sustained economic growth.    Since the debtor countries must look to the wealthierstates for markets for their products as well as financialassistance, economic weakness in the developed nations' economies poses fundamental worries.    Debtor countries, including the very poorest states, haveonly a few avenues open to them for earning foreign exchange,including the key one of exports.    The U.S. economy, which is in its fifth year of expansion,has served as a mainstay for developing country exports, but ittoo is seen as being rather feeble this year, growing by only2.3 pct, according to the IMF.    For this reason and because of a high trade deficit, theUnited States has been pressuring Japan and West Germany toignite their economies but with little apparent success.    The IMF study also examines the course of the dollar andthe curious lack of impact it has had on the U.S. tradedeficit.    Reagan administration officials have been saying that theimpact is now beginning to show up, although it has been muchslower than expected.    The IMF observed in its World Economic Outlook that it hasto be recognized that exchange rate adjustments take time towork through to payments flows -- probably at least three yearsto get a resonably complete effect.""

The case involved a hostile takeover bid by Dynamics Corpof America against CTS Corp, based in Elkhart, Ind.    Dynamics made a tender offer in 1985 for one million sharesto bring its holdings of CTS stock to 27.5 pct of the company'stotal.       After CTS invoked the state law, Dynamics filed a lawsuitchallenging the constitutionality of the measure.

It also requires that the acquisition for control shares inan Indiana corporation does not include voting rights unless amajority of all pre-existing shareholders so agree at theirnext regularly scheduled meeting.

"trade,","usa,",SENATE PREPARING FOR NEW U.S. BUDGET BATTLE,"Congress returned from its Easterrecess ready for the annual Spring budget battle that promisesto be a partisan dispute.    The budget fight pitting Democrats against President Reaganand Republicans is expected to get underway this week in theSenate late this week and last at least another week. It istaking on new prominence because of current trade woes.    That is because the budget problems and its associated hugedeficits are said to be at the root of related internationaltrade friction currently worrying financiers.    As the dollar slides downward on global markets and stockexchanges gyrate wildly, the trade dispute involving the UnitedStates and Japan once again is spreading fears of a major tradewar between the two trading giants for the first time sinceWorld War II.    Ostensibly that dispute is over U.S. charges that Japan isrefusing to open its markets to semi-conductor chips and theresulting U.S. tariffs doubling prices of Japanese televisionsand small computers.    Behind the elements of a brewing trade war which neitherside wants, is the dilemma of the U.S. budget and its deficit.    Some analysts say the financial markets may be waking up tothe economic realities that the huge debt cannot continue togrow without repercussions.    A large portion of the U.S. debt has been financed byforeigners from their accumulated trade surpluses. But if theywithdraw this support the result can only be further problems,including higher interest rates for Americans.    In a nutshell, the U.S. budget process has now moved to theshowdown stages in Congress. Reagan's own trillion dollarspending budget for the government year 1988, starting Oct. 1,was trounced badly in the House on April 9.    The Senate takes up a plan similar to one that passed theHouse, calling for slashing the deficit from its estimated 171billion dlr level next year to about 134 billion dlrs, throughdefense and domestic spending cuts and about 18.5 billion dlrsin new, unspecified, taxes. As the Senate prepares to take upits own budget plan, majority Democrats predict there will bepassage of a bill, only after a protracted partisan battle.    In the House, not one Republican voted for the budget,which passed by 230 to 192. In the Senate, none of Reagan'sRepublicans voted for the budget as it passed out of the SenateBudget Committee for full Senate consideration.    A key Senate Budget Committee source told Reuters hebelieves this very unusual unanimous opposition was by designamong congressional Republicans, perhaps with the tacitapproval of the White House.

"sugar,","australia,",SOAKING RAINS BOOST DRY AUSTRALIAN SUGAR CANE AREA,"Good soaking rain is boosting the sugarcane crop in the key Mackay region of Queensland following aprolonged dry spell relieved only by intermittent falls, anAustralian Sugar Producers Association spokesman told Reuters.    The rains began late last week, developed into heavydownpours over the weekend and are continuing today, he saidfrom Brisbane.    The Mackay and Burdekin regions, which together grow abouthalf the Australian cane crop, have been the Queensland caneareas hardest hit by unseasonal dry weather since December.    The spokesman said the rain missed the Burdekin area, justto the north of the Mackay region on the central Queenslandcoastal fringe, although recent light showers have freshenedthe crop there.    Owing to the dry spell in the Mackay and Burdekin areas,the overall 1987 Australian cane crop is likely to be below the25.4 mln tonnes crushed in 1986 for a 94 net titre raws outturnof 3.37 mln tonnes, he said.    But any decline will not be as great as seemed likely acouple of months ago when it appeared the Mackay-Burdekin cropswere going to suffer badly, he said.    Preliminary crop estimates are expected to be availableearly next month, the spokesman said.    The crush in the Mackay-Burdekin is likely to start laterthis year, in late June or early July against mid-June lastyear, to allow the cane to grow and sweeten further, he said.    The crush normally runs to around the end of December.    Elsewhere in the sugar belt, the cane is doing well, withsome mill areas expecting record crops, he said.    Industry records show variations in the crop are not alwaysmirrored in raws output. In 1985, 24.4 mln tonnes of sweetercane than in 1986 produced 3.38 mln tonnes of raws. REUTER",2,26

President of the powerful and independent West Germancentral bank, the Bundesbank, Poehl is likely to have hiscontract renewed for another eight years when it expires at theend of this year, government officials say.    (Index of economic spotlights, see page ECRA)    But no official announcement has yet been made, raisingeyebrows in West Germany's business community.    The ebullient Poehl spent seven years in Bonn in topministerial posts under the Social Democrats, now inopposition, before he moved to the Bundesbank.    There has been speculation that Chancellor Helmut Kohlwould try to replace Poehl with a man closer to his ownChristian Democrats. But officials noted that Poehl has workedclosely and successfully with Finance Minister GerhardStoltenberg since Kohl's government took office in 1982.    Poehl, the most senior central banker apart from PaulVolcker of the United States, enjoys a strong internationalreputation which it would take a newcomer years to build up.    Given these circumstances, Kohl will probably overlookPoehl's past as an adviser to former Social Democrat ChancellorWilly Brandt, and top aide to Helmut Schmidt when he wasFinance Minister, bankers said. It was Schmidt who, asChancellor, appointed Poehl to his present job in 1980.    In recent months, with the mark's strong rise against thedollar, Poehl has made exchange rates the central concern ofthe Bundesbank's council, a highly conservative institutionwhich has doggedly pursued monetary policies to preventinflation catching hold. Older Germans can remember two boutsof galloping inflation this century.    But with consumer prices falling for much of 1986, andinflation negligible so far this year, Poehl thinks it is safeto relax the monetary reins a little and concentrate on thedangers to the German economy of a bloated exchange rate.
