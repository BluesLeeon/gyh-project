"money-supply,","usa,","U.S. MONEY GROWTH SLOWS SHARPLY, ECONOMISTS SAY","U.S. money supply growth is slowingdown rapidly, and some economists believe that all three of theFederal Reserve's main monetary aggregates may even havecontracted in February.    A contraction is unlikely to be a major concern for theFed, especially as it would follow a long period of torridgrowth, but it could give the central bank extra leeway in theweeks ahead if it decided that a relaxation of monetary policywas justified on account of weakness in the economy.        M-1 money supply for the week ended February 23, reportedtoday, rose 1.9 billion dlrs to 738.5 billion, but preliminaryforecasts call for a drop next week of around two billion dlrs.The monthly average in January was 737.1 billion dlrs.    M-1 makes up about a quarter of M-2 and a fifth of M-3.With other components of M-2, such as money-market depositaccounts and small time deposits, also falling, the stage isset for falls in the broader aggregates too, economists say.    M-1 has been largely discredited because its traditionallink to economic growth has disintegrated under the impact offalling interest rates and banking deregulation.    But the consistent behavior of all three aggregates islikely to impress the Fed, said Ward McCarthy of Merrill LynchEconomics Inc.    The Fed has confidence in the aggregates when they're allsending the same signal. This is going to raise some eyebrowsat the Fed",4,11

Its new currency, the European Currency Unit (Ecu), hasbeen a runaway success with investors and borrowers alikeseeking an alternative to the volatile dollar.    And on Wednesday, the long term vision of the Ecu asEurope's common currency took a step nearer to becoming realitywhen Belgium minted the world's first Ecu coin.    But economists say members such as West Germany have so farblocked a second stage of development envisaged by the system'sfounding fathers, ex-West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt andformer French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing.    Under this phase, originally due to have started two yearsafter the EMS was set up, decision-making was to have beentransferred from national governments and central banks to anautonomous European Monetary Fund.

The depressed economy forms the main backdrop to generalelections next month in Indonesia, a major producer of rubber,palm oil, tin, timber and coffee.

The newspaper said the inter-agency government study founda serious oil-dependency problem due to steadily fallingdomestic production and rising demand for imported oil.

Sumita told reporters major nations have cooperated tobring about currency stability in line with the Parisagreement, which stipulated that they would closely cooperateto that end. He repeated the central bank will intervene ifnecessary, adding he did not think a dollar free-fall waslikely.    But Sumita said he could not say exactly what currencylevels would be considered in line with underlying economicfundamentals.    In Paris on February 22, Britain, Canada, France, Japan,the U.S. And West Germany agreed to cooperate to holdcurrencies around their then current levels.    Sumita said he could not find any specific reasons behindthe fall of the dollar to a record low against the yenyesterday.

U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said over the weekendthat the Paris pact did not encompass fixed tragets for thedollar.

This would be well below the 813.0 mln dlrs earned in thefirst three quarters of 1985/86. In the full year ended May 311986 the group earned a record 988.2 mln dlrs.    The analysts estimated that the group would report a thirdquarter net in the region of 200 mln to 220 mln dlrs, against238.6 mln a year earlier and 220.3 mln in the second quarter.    BHP's earnings in the first half ended November 30 amountedto 397.0 mln dlrs, sharply down from 589.3 mln a year earlier.    The analysts predicted that BHP will report an upturn inpetroleum earnings compared with the first quarter, reflectingsome improvement in crude oil prices from the Bass Straitfields, but these gains would be offset by lower mineral andsteel earnings.    They said the mineral group has been hit by lower coalprices and shipments to Japan while the steel division has beenaffected by industrial and production problems.    The analysts noted that the third quarter is normally BHP'slowest-earning period owing to a number of seasonal factors,and they predicted a sharp rise in fourth quarter net to around300 mln dlrs.    One key factor in the fourth quarter is expected to be atax break of some 70 mln dlrs for the investment allowance oncapital expenditure in the steel division, they said.    They said they saw BHP's full year earnings at around 900mln to 920 mln dlrs. They added that such a decline from1985/86 would be no surprise, noting BHP has said that it wouldbe difficult to equal its record 1985/86 net profit. REUTER",0,26

If OPEC does not increase overall output in the second halfof the year, prices will tend to increase, because non-OPECproducers have not been able to produce more oil at currentprices, he said.

Asked whether a dollar/yen rate of 148 or 149 reflectedeconomic fundamentals, he said current rates almost reflectfundamentals.    Sumita told reporters major nations have cooperated tobring about currency stability in line with the Parisagreement, which stipulated that they would closely cooperateto that end. He repeated the central bank will intervene ifnecessary, adding he did not think a dollar free-fall waslikely.    But Sumita said he could not say exactly what currencylevels would be considered in line with underlying economicfundamentals.    In Paris on February 22, Britain, Canada, France, Japan,the U.S. And West Germany agreed to cooperate to holdcurrencies around their then current levels.    Sumita said he could not find any specific reasons behindthe fall of the dollar to a record low against the yenyesterday. But he said the market rushed to sell dollars as itnervously reacted to statements abroad and to developmentssurrounding trade tensions.    U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said over the weekendthat the Paris pact did not encompass fixed tragets for thedollar. U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter calledU.S/Japan relations on certain key trade issues very strained.    The market reacted nervously because the dollar has beenmoving narrowly against the yen since mid-January, Sumita said.He added he does not expect the yen/dollar exchange rate toremain unstable because the market is concerned about a sharprise of the yen.    The Bank of Japan will keep a close watch on exchange ratesin line with the Paris accord, he added. REUTER",9,15

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,Redstone, who controls Dedham, Mass.,-based National AmusementsInc, a theater chain operator, offered to raise the cashportion of its Viacom offer to 42 dlrs a share from 40.50 dlrs.    Redstone also raised the face value of the preferred stockhe is offering to 7.50 dlrs from six dlrs.    The Redstone offer, which is being made through ArsenalHoldings Inc, a National Amusements subsidiary set up for thatpurpose, which also give Viacom shareholders one-fifth of ashare of Arsenal common stock after the takeover.    Viacom said earlier today it received revised takeover bidsfrom Redstone and MCV Holdings Inc, a group led by Viacommanagement which is competing with Redstone for control of thecompany and already has a formal merger agreement with Viacom.    The company did not disclose the details of the revisedoffers, but said a special committee of its board would reviewthem later today.    The Redstone group, which has a 19.5 pct stake in Viacom,and the management group, which has a 5.4 pct stake, have bothagreed not to buy more shares of the company until a merger iscompleted, unless the purchases are part of a tender offer forat least half of the outstanding stock.    The two rivals also signed confidentiality agreements,which give them access to Viacom's financial records providedthey keep the information secret.    In his SEC filing, Redstone, who estimated his cost ofcompleting the takeover at 2.95 billion dlrs, said Bank ofAmerica is confident it can raise 2.275 billion dlrs.    Besides the financing it would raise through a banksyndicate, Bank of America has also agreed to provide aseparate 25 mln dlr for the limited purpose of partialfinancing and has committed to provide another 592 mln dlrs,Redstone said.

"interest,","japan,",TOKYO STOCK PLUNGE COULD FORCE EASIER MONEY POLICY,"Plunging Tokyo stock prices will preventthe Bank of Japan from raising its discount rate and could evenforce it to ease monetary policy if the collapse continues,government and private economists said.    A rise in interest rates now would only serve to sparkfurther selling of shares that could ultimately have a majordeflationary impact on the real economy, they said.    Although Bank of Japan officials have consistentlymaintained that they had no plans to raise the 2.5 pct discountrate, many in the markets have thought otherwise.     Fears of a rise in the discount rate were fanned by thecentral bank's apparent decision last week to countenancehigher rates on commercial bills, dealers said.    But today's stock market collapse -- prices fell nearly 15pct -- means that the Bank of Japan would be hard pressed toraise the discount rate now, despite its concerns about arenewed outbreak of inflation, dealers and economists said.    Japanese government bond prices rose sharply today as themarkets concluded that the stock market's collapse precludedthe central bank from carrying out the widely-rumoured discountrate increase.    A senior government economist suggested that both the U.S.And Japan needed to ease monetary policy now to prevent afurther drop in New York and Tokyo stock prices.

But margins improved in the second half and in particularrefining and marketing in Eastern Canada showed a goodrecovery.    The company was commenting on results that showed a netloss for the year of 62.1 mln stg after a 71.6 mln profit in1985.    The fourth quarter charges included a 20.8 mln stgprovision on a retroactive price agreement recently initialledby Pertamina and Japanese buyers of the company's liquidnatural gas and 4.7 mln for the early months of its ownershipof Gulf Canada's marketing assets.    Ultramar said it had also included the estimated cost of afurther reorganisation programme, which was partly offset by awithdrawal of surplus funds from U.S. Pension schemes, and a13.5 mln stg provision for the estimated cost of selling itsU.S. Flag shipping operation.    The immediate outlook for crude oil prices was uncertainalthough it was unlikely there would be any sizeable increasein the near term. However, Ultramar said it was optimisticprices would strengthen over the longer term.    Its substantial reserves of crude oil and natural gas putit in a good position to benefit from any price recovery.    In the meantime, Ultramar's objectives were to improveprofitability by selling or restructuring weak operations whilestrengthening core businesses and developing a soundoperational and financial base.

Currency options pioneered by the PHLX in 1982 had becomean accepted means of hedging against foreign exchange risk andhad grown in popularity, he said.

Giordano was in Sydney to start an Asian-Pacific tour byexchange executives promoting the hedging benefits of theexchange-trade currency option market against existingover-the-counter option trading during the local working day.    Currency options pioneered by the PHLX in 1982 had becomean accepted means of hedging against foreign exchange risk andhad grown in popularity, he said.    The PHLX now offered options in eight currencies, includinga new Australian dollar option, and traded an average 42,000contracts daily with underlying open interest of more than 30billion U.S. Dlrs.    Giordano said the exchange had been impressed with theperformance of its Australian dollar contract, which since itsintroduction last year had regularly topped the French franc asthe third most popular traded option, with up to 8,000contracts traded daily.    Having the Philadelphia exchange open during theAsia-Pacific market day would open new hedging opportunities,set a truer level for over-the-counter option trading, increasearbitraging opportunities and give corporations and treasuriesaccess to a currency option market of much greater depth andliquidity with the security of a clearing house, he said.

Hong Kong-based Enim Oil is contracted to spend 120 mlndlrs over the next six years, including 10 mln in the first twoyears.    The 1,137 sq km Lematang block is located between two oilproducing sectors of South Sumatra, and Enim officials saidthere is a good chance of getting a high return on investment.

Wilhelm Christians said.    Credit business declined in the first few weeks of theyear, and the interest margin was squeezed further. The weakGerman bourse saw earnings on commission fall sharply, andtrading in securities also fell. But earnings from currencydealing were still satisfactory, he told a news conference.    Deutsche group partial operating profits rose to 3.78billion marks in 1986 from 2.92 billion in 1985 on a balancesheet of 257.22 billion marks after 237.23 billion.    Profits were swollen by earnings from the placement of theformer Flick group, which have been estimated at some onebillion marks, and from record profits in trading on the bank'sown account, not included in partial operating profits.    Earnings from the Flick transaction were booked through asubsidiary, and therefore showed up as part of the interestsurplus in a section current earnings from securities andparticipations.    In the group this nearly doubled to 2.64 billion marks from1.45 billion.    As usual the bank did not detail total operating profits.    But it said that total operating profits, including ownaccount trading, rose 24.9 pct or 4.5 pct without the Flicktransaction in the group, and 35.1 pct or seven pct in theparent bank.    Banking analysts said this put group total operatingprofits at some 6-1/2 to seven billion marks, and parent bankoperating profits at over five billion marks.    Christians said Deutsche used the extraordinary earningsfrom Flick to pay a record five mark bonus on top of itsunchanged 12 mark dividend.    The bank had decided against raising the dividend itselfbecause of the uncertain business outlook at the end of 1986,and developments so far this year showed that was correct,Christians said.    West German banks rarely raise dividends unless they aresure they can maintain the increased payout in subsequentyears, preferring to use bonuses for one-of profits.    The bank also used its extraordinary earnings to continue ahigh level of risk provision, Christians said.    Disclosed group risk provisions rose to 867 mln marks in1986 from 765 mln in 1985.    Under German law, disclosed provisions do not necessarilyreflect the full amount of risk provisions.    Management board joint spokesman Alfred Herrhausen saidDeutsche's total debt exposure to problem countries had fallento over six billion marks in 1986 from 7.4 billion in 1985because of the fall in the dollar.    He agreed with a questioner who asked if over two thirds ofsuch problem country debt had been written off.    Deutsche Bank posted a sharp rise in holdings of othersecurities",0,23

WestLB International will pay a 12.5 mln mark dividend toWestLB, down from 47.7 mln a year earlier.    The dividend was lower than in 1985 because the recordprofit of the previous year could not be repeated, due tochanged market conditions, it said. Increased funds were alsoallocated for provisions. Business in the first three months of1987 developed positively, it added.    WestLB International set aside 115.3 mln marks forinternational credit risks in 1986, up from 97.4 mln marks in1985, bringing the total amount of provisions shown in thebalance sheet to 580.3 mln marks.    Operating profit fell to 122 mln marks in 1986 from 150 mlnin 1985. Balance sheet total fell to 9.7 billion marks from10.8 billion, reflecting the lower dollar and the fact thatcredit business redemptions were not fully offset by newlending.    The statement said WestLB International's business withprivate customers showed a pleasing expansion last year.    This development was aided by cooperation between the bankand the savings banks in the West German state of NorthRhine-Westphalia, where parent bank WestLB is based.

But they would be given a muchgreater role under an idea being floated by Governor RobertHeller, who joined the board last August.    He conceeds that much more study of the idea is needed, butargues that such an arrangement, particularly if it wereadopted by other major industrial countries, could reduce thevolatility of exchange rates.    Moreover, it could help stabilize of the prices ofcommodities themselves, slowing changes in inflation.    His idea, which many conservative economists findappealing, has some backing among board members appointed inrecent years by President Reagan.    It would complement the present system of opening orclosing the monetary screws based on the pattern of inflation,key indicators such as unemployment, and the rise or fall ofthe money supply. Changes in the money supply can lead tochanges in interest rates and affect economic activitydirectly.

A statement issued by the Wallenberg holding companies ABInvestor and Forvaltnings AB Providentia said they had takenover an option held by Nobel Industrier Sweden AB to acquire 33pct of the voting rights in Swedish Match.    Thre Wallenbergs paid Nobel Industrier <NOBL ST>, in whichPenser group has a 72 pct stake, about 20 pct over the marketprice for the Swedish Match option, the statement said.    Swedish Match's B shares open to foreign buyers closed at424 crowns on Friday. The A shares -- with increased votingrights -- closed at 450 crowns for the restricted and 455 forthe free shares.    The statement said the deal increased Investor's stake to49.4 pct of the voting rights and 14.8 pct of the share capitalwhile Providentia is left holding 34.1 pct of the voting rightsand 14.5 pct of the share capital in Swedish Match.    The Wallenbergs' stake in Swedish Match had previouslyamounted to 52 pct of the voting rights in the company.    The Swedish Match deal will cost the Wallenbergs about 400mln crowns, share analysts said, making it one of the mostexpensise moves the group has undertaken in the last four yearsto defend its far-flung interests from outside predators.    The Wallenbergs originally sold Nobel Industrier, an armsand chemicals group, to Penser in 1984 to pay for buying Volvo<VOLV ST> out of two other key group companies, Atlas Copco<ASTS ST> and Stora Koppabergs <SKPS ST>.

During 1986, the Wallenbergs have been concentrating onbuilding up their stake in Investor and Providentia to preventany raid on the heart of their business empire.    But analysts say the Wallenbergs' position in theelectrical engineering firm ASEA AB <ASEA ST> is also too smallat 12.6 pct of the voting rights and there has been growingspeculation that the group will be forced to sell off fringeinterests to protect its core activities.

The court overturned a claim by Danny Dattel that a casefor damages should not be allowed after such a long interval.    Herstatt creditors are seeking 12.5 mln marks from Dattel,whom they accuse of causing losses at the bank of over 500 mlnmarks by manipulating forward foreign exchange contracts.    The crash of the private Herstatt bank with losses of overone billion marks stunned West Germany's business community,and led to a tightening of banking regulations.    The losses were even greater than the 480 mln marksannounced recently by Volkswagen as a result of fraud incurrency transactions.    Ivan Herstatt, managing director of the bank when itcollapsed, was sentenced to four and a half years in prison in1984 but appealed. Six other people associated with the bankwere jailed in 1983.    But Dattel was freed from prosecution after he producedmedical evidence of paranoia caused by Nazi persecution duringhis childhood, which might have led him to take his own life. Reuter",9,23

The government economists acknowledged that the improvedexport performance in the January/March quarter was unlikely tobe repeated. The volume of exports during the period was up twopct from the previous three months.    The yen's rise in April to about 140 to the dollar from 150probably resulted in a fall in exports in the April/Junequarter, they said.    However, given the yen's recent stability, stepped-updomestic demand should work as a driving force to push theeconomy onto a path of sustainable growth, they said.    Many private economists, though, doubt that the economywill achieve the government's 3.5 pct growth forecast for the1987/88 year.    Growth in 1986/87 also fell short of the government'sforecast, which was revised downwards to three pct lastDecember from an original four pct.    Domestic demand as a whole is not strong enough, except forhousing, said Johsen Takahashi, chief economist at MitsubishiResearch Institute.    Consumer spending is likely to remain weak as the growth innominal income stays low, he added.     The rise in consumer spending in the January-March quarterwas simply a reflection of the contraction that occurred in thepreceding three months, Takahashi said.    Private capital spending in the quarter looked strong butthis was primarily because utility companies brought forwardtheir 1987/88 capital investment plans into the final quarterof 1986/87 in line with the government's economic stimulationpackage announced last fall, he said.    Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank chief economist Kosaku Furuta said hewas unable to say the economy has bottomed out, but added heexpects increasing signs of recovery in the coming months.    Destocking is coming to an end and companies are startingto rebuild inventories, Furuta said.    Housing is expected to remain buoyant, backed up by lowerinterest rates as well as government policies to stimulate thesector, he said. The government's recently unveiled 6,000billion yen economic package will also help the economy.    But he said that the economy was unlikely to achieve thegovernment's 3.5 pct forecast for 1987/88, although growthmight come close to three pct. REUTER",10,15

The cuts follow nearly two months after theBundesbank reduced leading interest rates, far longer than theusual interim period.    A Deutsche Bank AG <DBKG.F> spokesman said it is cuttingleading savings rate for private customers on a regional basisby 0.5 percentage points to two pct. Dresdner Bank AG <DRSD.F>and Commerzbank AG <CBKG.F> have initiated similar moves. Bankfuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG <BKFG.F> cut rates 0.5 pct generally.    The delay was partly due to commercial banks' desire togauge customer reaction to a similar move by regional savingsbanks.    A fall in customer savings because of lower rates couldreduce cheap refinancing available to banks, forcing them todraw down relatively expensive funds from other sources, oneeconomist at the German Banking Association said.    But the volume of savings funds may not be substantiallyundercut by lower savings rates because many customers areparking funds in savings accounts in the hope they can reinvestthem at higher yields in the future, he said.    He said this may conflict with Bundesbank aims to move morefunds from relatively short-term deposits to longer-datedsecurities to reduce strong growth in its central bank moneysupply aggregate.    The aggregate showed annualized growth of a provisional 7.5pct in February against the fourth quarter of last year,unchanged from January. The growth rate was outside theexpanded target range of three to six pct.    Few banks have so far reduced lending rates to privatecustomers, though lending rates for corporate customers arebeginning to decline. REUTER",7,23

The group earlier reported its net earnings dropped to603.0 mln dlrs in the first three quarters ended February 28from 813.0 mln a year earlier.    Third quarter net fell to 206.0 mln dlrs from 238.6 mln ayear earlier and 220.3 mln in the second quarter ended November31, BHP said in a statement.    Earnings in the first nine months were at the lower end ofshare analysts' forecasts yesterday of a range of 600 mln to620 mln dlrs.    BHP held its annual dividend unchanged at 37.5 cents afterdeclaring a steady final dividend of 20 cents and announced aone-for-five bonus issue to shareholders registered May 1.    The bonus is being made from reserves which will notqualify for tax-free distribution after the introduction ofdividend imputation next July 1.    The bonus shares will not rank for the final dividend, BHPsaid.    BHP said it should not be expected that the present rate ofdividend will be maintained on the increased capital.    The level of future dividends will be influenced by theimplications of the proposed dividend imputation legislation,it said.    As previously reported, dividends will become tax-free inshareholders' hands provided they are paid out of profits thathave borne the full 49 pct company tax rate.    BHP, which confined comment to the third quarter, saidpetroleum net earnings dropped to 98.8 mln dlrs from 139.6 mlna year earlier, and steel profit to 27.0 mln from 48.8 mln.    BHP said the petroleum division earnings fall reflectedgenerally lower oil prices and sales volumes from Bass Straitwhile the steel decline was due to a five pct fall in domesticsales and higher costs associated with the commissioning of newplant and some operational difficulties.    The rise in third quarter minerals net to 95.7 mln dlrsfrom 81.5 mln a year earlier largely reflected the increase inownership of the Mt Newman iron ore project, it said.

They said the maximum rebate of 45.678 European currencyUnits (Ecus) per 100 kilos was 0.87 Ecus below what producersclaim is needed to obtain the equivalent price to that offeredfor sales into intervention.    The rebate at last week's tender was 1.3 Ecus short of thelevel producers thought necessary and that of the previous weekwas 2.5 Ecus below this level.    But the sources said producers who have offered a total of854,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention in an apparentattempt to persuade the Commission to set higher maximumrebates have given no formal indication to the Commission thatthey intend to withdraw these offers.    The French and German operators involved would be able towithdraw the offers up to five weeks after April 1 when thesugar will officially enter intervention stores.    The five-week period is the normal delay between sugargoing into intervention and payment being made for it.

Oil use in the 24 member countries of the Organization forEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) increased by aroundone pct in the first quarter of 1987 to 35.9 mln barrels a day,the IEA said in its latest monthly report.    Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily fromtransport fuels, as was the case in 1986. But if averageconsumer prices are higher than 1986, the rate of growth forthese fuels may be below last year's 3.6 pct.    The IEA said assuming crude and product prices remain narcurrent levels, some destocking by end-users can be expected.    If that takes place, natural gas will also regain some ofthe market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986, it said.    IEA estimates on April one put oil stocks held in the OECDarea at 428 mln tonnes, or 98 days of forward consumption. Thisis about the same as at the begining of the year.    The agency said this flat trend is explained by theprojected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter ofthe year which offset a reduction in stocks.    Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonneson April one this year compared with 316 mln tonnes in calender1986 while governments also built up their strategic stocks to102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in 1986.    The year-on-year trend of government stock building iscontinuing with company stocks rising, more or less in linewith consumption, after declining for five years, IEA said.    Oil stocks on land in the United States and Canada were putat 206.6 mln tonnes down from the 214 mln tonnes on January oneand equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption, respectively.    Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes, downfrom the 154 mln tonnes on January one but still equivalent to94 days of consumption.    The IEA said that initial estimates indicate that companystocks fell by 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the firstquarter of the year. This followed a small rise in January of400,000 bpd but a decline of 1.5 bpd in February and 2.5 bpd inMarch.    And it is possible that final data will show a larger draw,particulary for March, it said.    As crude production also fell, there is likely to have alsobeen a decline in non-reported stocks, particularly at sea, theIEA said.    World oil supply fell through the first quarter by abouttwo bpd to 45.2 bpd from 47.5 bpd in the last quarter of 1986.    This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crudeproduction to around 15.5 bpd in February/March from 16.5 bpdin January and to the seasonal drop in exports from CentrallyPlanned Economies, the IEA said.    Total OPEC oil supply totalled 17.2 bpd in the firstquarter of 1987 compare with 19.3 bpd in the last three monthsof 1986 while supply from non-OPEC countries totalled 28 bpd asagainst 28.2 bpd in the same 1986 period.    A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast3.3 bpd in march from 3.6 bpd in February was the largestfactor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEA said. Reuter",6,29

"crude,","canada,",CANADA SETS OIL INDUSTRY AID PACKAGE,"Canada's federal governmentwill provide a 350 mln dlr oil industry aid package thatincludes cash incentives designed to cover one-third of acompany's oil and gas exploration and development costs, EnergyMinister Marcel Masse announced.    The aid program will inject about 350 mln dlrs a year intothe oil and gas industry and could lead to more than onebillion dlrs in new investment, Masse told a news conference.    The program will affect drilling done anywhere in Canada onor after April 1, 1987.    Masse told reporters that the government's oil industry aidpackage is aimed at small and medium sized companies.    The aid package, called the Canadian Exploration andDevelopment Incentive Program, will restrict the total paymentsthat any individual company can claim to 10 mln dlrs a year.    Masse said the program will probably generate newemployment equivalent to 20,000 people working for a year.    He said oil industry aid is needed because exploration anddevelopment spending dropped by at least 50 pct since world oilprices fell during the first half of 1986.    Energy Minister Masse said the federal government decidedto provide cash incentives so a large number of non-tax payingcompanies, mainly small Canadian firms, will receive the fullvalue of the incentive. Such companies would not immediatelybenefit from tax benefits, he said.    The federal government also wanted to deliver an aidprogram outside the tax system. Finance Minister Michael Wilsonis now reviewing Canada's tax system and plans to announce taxreform proposals later this spring.    An important feature of the aid program is a decision tolet companies issue flow-through shares, allowing investors tobenefit from the subsidy rather than restricting benefits toonly participating companies, he said.    Allowing flow-through shares under the program will make iteasier for companies to attract investors in exploration anddevelopment, Masse said.    He told reporters his department is still consideringwhether to allow partnerships and other entities to qualify forthe subsidy. Reuter",6,12

Nugent said in a speech to the Texas house ofrepresentatives that the state must take the initiative inmolding U.S. energy policy and finding new ways to assisttroubled oil producers.    His proposal to revitalize Texas' oil industry would exemptstripper wells that produce 10 barrels of oil or less each dayfrom the state's 4.6 pct severance tax. He said that themajority of Texas' oil wells fall within the stripper wellcategory and a price swing of two to three dlrs a barrel can becrucial in determining if the well remains in production.    Nugent also called for state lawmakers to exempt newwildcat wells from the state severance tax for up to five yearsas a financial incentive to explore for new oil reserves.    Secondary and tertiary oil production, expensive methods ofproduction that inject water or gas into the ground to recoveroil, should also be exempted from the severance tax, Nugentsaid. His plan would exempt existing secondary and tertiarywells that produce at a rate of less than three barrels a dayfor three years, or until the price of oil reaches $25 abarrel.

"crude,","australia,",AUSTRALIA SAID TO RELY TOO MUCH ON OIL TAXES,"The government'sover-reliance on revenue from crude oil is adversely affectingAustralia's economic performance, Australian PetroleumExploration Association (APEA) chairman Dennis Benbow said.    Over one-third of Australia's indirect tax income isderived from oil at a time of falling domestic output and weakcrude prices, he told the APEA annual conference here.    This dependence on oil-generated revenue distorts thecountry's economic performance directly by acting as adisincentive to new exploration and indirectly by affectingtrading competitiveness through high energy costs, he said.    Australia's medium-term liquid fuel self-sufficiencyposition is posing a major economic threat, yet thegovernment's response has been to load new tax burdens on theoil industry, Benbow said.    Domestic oil output from existing fields is expected tofall to 280,000 barrels per day (bpd) in fiscal 1992/93 from546,000 bpd in 1985/86, reflecting mainly the decline of theBass Strait fields, he said.    Bass Strait reserves are now two-thirds depleted, with thethree largest fields 80 pct depleted, he said.    By 1992/93, Bass Strait output is expected to be just overhalf the 1985/86 level, assuming a number of so far undevelopedfields are brought on stream and enhanced recovery fromexisting fields goes ahead, Benbow said.    Government projections of output from as yet undiscoveredfields range from 40,000 to 130,000 bpd, he said.    Australian liquid fuel demand is forecast to rise to680,000 bpd in 1992/93 from 565,000 in 1985/86, implying acrude oil gap of between 270,000 and 360,000 bpd in five yearstime, he said.    At present world oil prices and the current value of theAustralian dollar, annual oil imports in 1992/93 would costbetween 3.2 billion and 3.6 billion dlrs, Benbow said.    Despite intensive exploration in the early 1980's, theaddition to reserves has been inadequate, he said.

The unadjusted rise was 1.31 billion stg, compared with an813 mln stg increase in January.    The Banking Information Service said the adjusted rise of1.6 billion stg was well above the recent monthly average ofabout 1.0 billion stg.    Of the increase, 297 mln stg was accounted for by personallending, which the Banking Information Service said was takenup entirely by lending for home purchases.    Lending for consumption fell around 17 mln stg while about182 mln stg of credit card debt was repaid during the month.    Lending to the manufacturing industry was up 370 mln stg,and to leasing companies by 308 mln stg.    The Banking Information Service said February fell withinthe governmemnt tax season, so much of the lending was probablythe result of industry's need to pay its tax bills.    Deposits by the private sector rose an unadjusted 1.1billion stg in February and by a seasonally-adjusted 1.75billion stg.    Deposits from the public sector rose 185 mln stg inFebruary while deposits from overseas residents rose by 43 mln. REUTER",4,21

"interest,","japan,",JAPAN EXPECTED TO CUT BASE RATE FOR STATE BODIES,"Japan is expected to cut the base lendingrate for state financial institutions to 5.5 pct from 6.2 aspart of the recent pact by major industrial nations in Paris,Finance Ministry sources said.    They said the cut is based on a revision of the Trust FundBureau Law, which should be approved by parliament on March 3,abolishing the 6.05 pct minimum interest rate on deposits withthe bureau.    The bureau channels funds to government financialinstitutions for public works and other official uses, theysaid.    The base lending rate for state bodies such as the JapanDevelopment Bank, People's Finance Corp and the financecorporations of local public enterprises usually moves intandem with long-term prime rates, the sources said.    However, it was impossible for them to follow the last cut,to 5.8 pct from 6.2 pct on January 28, because the Trust FundBureau rate was legally set at 6.05 pct.    The ministry will abolish the minimum rate and introduce amarket-related one to resolve the problem and stimulate thedomestic economy, they said.    On Tuesday, the ministry allowed long-term bankers to cuttheir prime to a record low of 5.5 pct, effective February 28.The move suggested it had reached agreement with depositorsusing the bureau, the postal savings system of the Posts andTelecommunications Ministry and the Japan welfare annuity ofthe Ministry of Health and Welfare, the sources said.    These ministries are trying to determine which market ratesshould be considered when setting the bureau's deposit rate,the ministry sources said.    Coupon rates on new 10-year government bonds, minus 0.1percentage points, is the likeliest choice, they added. REUTER",7,15

Monier recently said it proposes to make a one-for-twobonus issue before June 30.    CSR will shortly announce further details of the offerincluding a CSR share alternative, it said in a statement.

Redland Plc <RDLD.L>, the holder of 49.87 pct of Monier,has agreed with CSR that Redland will not accept the offer forits stake initially, CSR said.

The second grants Redland the option to increase its Monierholding to 50.1 pct in the same period.    The second option is exercisable by Redland at 3.50 dlrs ashare, CSR said.

Redland has indicated that it would be prepared to considerat a later stage an increase in CSR's Monier stake to enable itto become a CSR subsidiary, assuming Redland exercises thesecond option, CSR said.

Purolator's stock slipped 3/8 today to close at 34-3/4. Ithad been trading slightly higher than the 35 dlr offer onFriday. At least one analyst Friday speculated the companymight fetch 38 to 42 dlrs per share.    analysts and wall street sources doubted a competitiveoffer would emerge since the company has been for sale forsometime before the deal with Hutton was struck Friday.    Hutton had been in talks with Purolator's adviser, Dillon,Read and Co since late December, a Hutton spokesman said.    Hutton is offering 35 dlrs cash per share for 83 pct of theshares. If all shares are tendered, shareholders would receive29 dlrs cash, six dlrs in debentures, and warrants for stock ina subsidiary of PC Acquisition containing the Purolator U.S.courier operation.

Consumer spending, a main driving force of domestic demand,was likely to remain lacklustre although brisk housing andbusiness investment would help sustain the economy this year,the economists said.    They said they were shocked by an Economic Planning Agencyreport today that private spending fell 0.7 pct in the Oct/Decquarter for the first time in 12 years.    The report said Japan's gross national product rose a real0.8 pct in Oct/Dec after a revised 0.7 pct increase in theprevious quarter.    It said GNP growth for 1986 was a real 2.5 pct, down from4.7 pct in 1985. Agency officials said this was the worstperformance since 1974 when GNP contracted 1.4 pct in the wakeof the first oil crisis.    They expressed concern about the 0.7 pct decline inconsumer spending in the final quarter of 1986 but said it wasonly temporary as exceptionally warm winter weather haddepressed retail sales.

Claims on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) rose by 298mln francs to 19.61 billion francs, due to net withdrawals infrancs by member nations, and an increase in reserves ofSpecial Drawing Rights (SDRs) due mainly to the repayment ofFrench debts.

President Robert Staubli told a news conference that thefirst two months of this year gave hope that 1987 profit wouldat least equal last year's figure, but said much depended onoutside factors such as fuel prices and the exchange rate.    The fall was largely due to a 60 mln franc loss onSwissair's core flying business last year, against a profit of27 mln francs the previous year, he said.    The net profit figure was reached after receipt of some 68mln francs from plane sales, compared with a mere 17 mln francsin 1985. Finance Head Martin Juenger said he expected around 20mln francs from sales this year, although said much depended onthe speed with which it decided to sell its DC-10s.    Gross profit for 1986 reached 340.5 mln francs, with 276mln francs subtracted for ordinary depreciation.    Gross profits for the previous year had been 382.5 mlnfrancs, with 314 mln subtracted for depreciation, including 45mln francs supplementary depreciation.    Staubli said the 1986 result, well below predictions madethis time last year, suffered considerably due to exchange ratefluctuations, in particular the strength of the Swiss franc.    While the negative effects on revenue of the sharp drop inthe dollar were partially compensated for by cheaper fuelprices, there was no such offset for the strength of the francagainst other European currencies.

The accounting change will not affect the company's cashposition and the company intends to continue paying itsdividend at the annual rate of 1.92 dlrs per share.    Last year Pacific Gas reported earnings of 925 mln dlrs, or2.60 dlrs per share.

It said the commission is currently allowing the company torecover 40 pct of the cost of owning and operating the plants.    As a result, 63 mln dlrs has been accumulating each monthas deferred non-cash account receivable, which has beenincluded in current income.    But the accounting change, effective January 1, willreflect only cash received through interim rates approved bythe commission, Pacific Gas and Electric said.

The company further stated that it is confident it willreceive an objective review of the facts.    It also said it intends to seek additional interim rates.

Results in the first few months show it heading inthe right direction, company president Klaus Jacobs said.    The group reported 1986 net profit of 190.9 mln Swissfrancs compared with 150.4 mln in 1985 and raised its dividendper bearer share to 160 francs from 155 francs.    Jacobs said the increase in profit, which far exceeded thecompany's target of five pct real annual growth, had been madepossible by restructuring measures introduced in January 1986which had also made some major acquisitions possible last year.    Hermann Pohl, general director in charge of economicaffairs, said the 2.7 pct decline in group turnover to 5.24billion francs was due to currency factors.    A 5.2 pct negative currency influence was partially offsetby growth in operations and by structural changes within thegroup.    Turnover in the coffee business fell to 3.10 billion francsfrom 3.56 billion in 1985 while turnover in the chocolatesector rose to 2.14 billion francs from 1.82 billion. Thetonnage sold in both sectors declined due to higher prices andlower consumer demand, especially in France and West Germany.    Jacobs Suchard increased its market share in West Germanyto 44.9 pct from 39.9 pct in 1985, largely as a result ofacquisitions. Market share in France was little changed at 25pct against 25.3 pct.    Pohl said the group's average tax rate rose to 32.5 pctfrom 28.8 pct because of the higher profits and despitewrite-offs on the losses of new acquisitions. A furtherincrease in tax levels was expected in future.    Taxes jumped 51.3 pct to 92 mln francs in 1986 from 61 mlnthe previous year. REUTER",0,22

British Petroleum PLC <BP> and Royal Dutch/Shell Group <RD>have also been mentioned as possible suitors for Dome.    In the past two days, Dome management has been pressured bythe federal government to select the offer from TransCanada,the only Canadian company in the bidding.

The partnership said the offer is further conditioned onGenCorp management withdrawing its proposals to amend thecompany's articles of incorporation and code of regulations toprovide for an increase in authorized common shares, aclassified board of directors and the elimination of cumulativevoting.  The latter two changes would make it harder forminority shareholders to elect directors.    General Partners said it is asking GenCorp for itsshareholder lists for help in disseminating the offer.    GenCorp has about 22.3 mln shares outstanding, making thevalue of the offer about 2.23 billion dlrs.    Last fall, AFG and Wagner and Brown offered to acquire<Lear Siegler Inc> for about 1.44 billion dlrs but withdrew theoffer when higher bids emerged and due to complications of theTax Reform Act of 1986.  Lear Siegler eventually went privatefor 1.66 billion dlrs.    GenCorp is involved in tire and plasticmaking and aerospaceas well as broadcasting.  The company faces challenges to itstwo television and 12 radio station licenses, partly becuase itfailed to inform the FCC about allegedly improper foreignpayments and political contributions.    GenCorp has agreed to sell its New York-area televisionstation WOR to MCA Inc <MCA> for 387 mln dlrs and its LosAngeles station KHJ to Walt Disney Co <DIS> for 217 mln dlrs.An investor group challenging the Los Angeles license wouldalso receive 103 mln dlrs from Disney.

Under the offer, Resorts said holders of its class A shareswould receive 15 dlrs a share in cash and three shares ofcommon stock in the new company.    Resorts said the offer from KSZ calls for a merger ofResorts with RI Acquisition Co Inc, a newly formed Delawarecorporation.    Resorts said that prior to the merger, RI Acquisition wouldbe capitalized with about 100 mln dlrs of debt and about 220mln dlrs of equity.    It said 200 mln dlrs of the equity would be in the form ofspecial preferred stock.    The KSZ offer, Resorts said, indicates that KSZ has acommitment from <M. Davies Cos> to buy all of the specialpreferred stock.    Resorts said the offer will expire at 1700 EST on March 27.It said it asked its investment advisor, Bear, Stearns and Co,to advise its board on the offer.    Earlier this month, the estate of James M. Crosby andcertian members of his family agreed to sell their class Bshares to New York real estate tycoon Donald Trump for 135 dlrsa share. The estate and family members hold 78 pct of the752,297 class B shares outstanding.    Trump also agreed to pay 135 dlrs a share for the remainingclass B shares outstanding.    Resorts also has about 5,680,000 shares of outstandingclass A stock. These shares carry one one-hundredth the votingpower of the class B shares.    Trump's offer beat out a rival bid of 135 dlrs a share madeby Pratt Hotel Corp <PRAT>.    Resorts said that under the proposal made by KSZ, existingclass A and class B shareholders would control about 96 pct ofthe outstanding common of the new company formed to acquireResorts.    Resorts said the new company, upon completion of themerger, would hold the 220 mln dlrs of debt and that thespecial preferred stock would immediately be converted intoexchangeable participating preferred of the new company.    This preferred, Resorts said, would pay a dividend based onthe net cash flows from the new company's Paradise Islandoperations.    A Resorts spokesman said the KSZ offer was made in atwo-page letter and that Resorts could not comment on itbecause it did not contain enough information. Resorts hasasked Bear, Sterns to obtain complete data, he said.

"money-fx,","west-germany,",CALL MONEY PRESSURE FROM LARGE GERMAN BANKS,"One or two large West German bankseffectively drained the domestic money market of liquidity atthe end of the month in order to achieve higher rates fromtheir overnight deposits, money dealers said.    As a result, call money soared in active trading to aroundthe Lombard rate of five pct from 3.70/80 pct yesterday asbanks found themselves short of minimum reserve funds.    Bundesbank figures showed that banks held an average daily51 billion marks in interest-free minimum reserve assets at thecentral bank over the first 29 days of the month.    Though this was above the March requirement of 50.7billion, actual holdings at the weekend were 44.2 billion.    To meet the daily average, dealers said, banks must raiseholdings by two billion marks to 46.3 billion today andtomorrow. But liquidity was tight in early business becausebanks excessively took up the Bundesbank's offer for sale ofTreasury bills on Friday. This provides a rate of 3.50 pct forthree-day deposits and is an effective floor to the market.    Though some liquidity, from bills bought on Thursday,flowed back into the market today, the bulk would not returnuntil tomorrow, the start of the new month, dealers said.    Dealers said the large banks, which they did not name,commanded short-term money requirements of as much as fivebillion marks or so.    With a knowledge of their own needs until the end of themonth, the banks bought excessive amounts of treasury bills,draining liquidity for three days. When other banks soughtfunds, rates rose and large banks were able to place excessfunds on deposit at a considerably higher average return.    One senior dealer said the Bundesbank, with advancedknowledge of the market's needs, should have curtailed itssales of treasury bills on Friday.    Though dealers only late in the day learn of the totalminimum reserve holdings of the previous day, the Bundesbankhas an immediate overview of the situation and could anticipatethe strength of demand for funds the following day, he said.    (Bundesbank dealers) could easily have said we are notselling any treasury bills or we're not selling them in thisamount",9,23

Siemens reported world group turnover in 1985/86 of 47.02billion marks.    Kaske told the annual shareholders meeting turnover rose to21.2 billion marks in the first five months of 1986/87, about19 pct above the same year-ago period. The rise was mainly dueto payment in January for a West German nuclear power stationwhich led to a jump in domestic sales of 36 pct.    In the first five 1986/87 months, turnover abroad showed athree pct increase, Kaske said, without giving figures.    In the same period incoming orders rose five pct to 21.8billion marks against the same 1985/86 period.    For the year as a whole incoming orders should rise betweenone and two billion marks to around 51 or 52 billion.    Apart from payments for the nuclear power station, thecommunications and telecommunications sectors in particularshould contribute to growth this year, Kaske said.    But it was not possible to make a profit forecast for1986/87 because of uncertainty about the direction of thedollar, Kaske said.    Siemens already reported that first quarter 1986/87 groupnet profit fell marginally to 296 mln marks from 298 mln in thesame period in the previous year.    Turnover in the first five months rose particularlystrongly in the installations and automotive technology,communications and telecommunications sectors, but componentsand energy and automation showed a sharp decline.    Kaske said domestic orders rose to 10.2 billion marks inthe first five months of this year, or nine pct above theirlevel in the same 1985/86 period, boosted in particular byorders for the fully owned Kraftwerk Union AG subsidiary.    Foreign orders grew one pct to 11.6 billion marks. Anincrease in orders through newly acquired subsidiaries abroadwas balanced by the decline in the dollar.    While the installations and automotive technology sectorshowed a sharp rise in orders, energy and automation andcommunications orders were below the level achieved in the sameperiod of 1985/86.    Telecommunications orders remained at roughly the samelevel.    Kaske said investments were expected to remain around sixbillion marks in 1986/87 after a 50 pct increase the previousyear.

Television crews which had been waiting outside Nagano'shome filmed two men smashing their way into the home and lateremerging with a bloodstained bayonet.

A 13.3 pct jump in non-interest expense to 471.3 mln dlrsfrom 415.9 mln also hit the bottom line. It said the rise wasmainly due to staff costs associated with continued growth inconsumer, capital markets and investment banking activities.    Excluding the effect of placing Brazil on non-accrual,Chemical said its net income would have been 98.2 mln dlrs, or4.3 pct below 1986 earnings.    Brazil suspended interest payments on 68 billion dlrs ofmedium- and long-term debt on February 20. If they are notresumed by year's end, Chemical said its after-tax net for thewhole of 1987 will be reduced by about 51 mln dlrs.    Chemical also placed 52 mln dlrs of loans to Ecuador onnon-accrual because the Quito government also suspendedinterest payments on its foreign debt. This reduced interestincome by 1.5 mln dlrs.    Chemical said net interest income fell to 476.4 mln dlrsfrom 488.9 mln and its net spread narrowed to 3.61 pct from3.96 pct.    This reflected the reclassification of Brazilian loans, areduced federal income tax rate (which affected the calculationof the taxabale-equivalent adjustment on tax-exempt assets) anda narrowing of the spread between the prime rate and Chemical'scost of funds.

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,Merrill Lynch Capital Partners Inc said it would receive a 30mln dlr fee from the surviving company for acting as dealermanager of the merger after the Borg-Warner deal is completed.    But it said it could also receive a break-up fee of 30 mlndlrs if the deal fails for reasons, which include another partyholding more than 40 pct of its stock or tendering for 50 pct.    The 30 mln dlr fee is among the highest set down in anytender offer agreement, either in compensation for dealermanager services or for break-up of the deal.    Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, backed by a group ofinvestors it organized, has launched a 48.50 dlr a share tenderoffer for Borg-Warner for 90 pct of its stock.    The company's board has approved the plan, which wasintended to thwart an unsolicited offer from GAF Corp.    Borg-Warner also agreed to redeem all outstanding Series Apreferred shares and to pay off on all options at a 48.50 dlr ashare exercise price before the merger is effective, it said.    Merrill Lynch said its representatives discussed a possibleleveraged buyout with Borg-Warner as early as last December.    At that time, Merrill Lynch told the company it wouldconsider a 43 dlr a share tender offer in cash and securities,if the Borg-Warner board approved, it said. On Feb 24, it saidit was told the company had decided against a buyout.    But talks were revived after GAF launched its 46 dlr ashare proposal on March 31, Merrill Lynch said.    Unlike its earlier proposal, Merrill Lynch said Borg-Warnermanagement was asked not to take part in the new deal and itwas conditioned upon payment of the fees.    In addition to its fees, Merrill Lynch said it will alsoget up to 17 mln dlrs from Borg-Warner to cover its expenses inthe tender offer.    Merrill Lynch said it would continue operating Borg-Warneras a subsidiary with its current officers keeping theirpositions.    But for flexibility purposes, Merrill Lynch said it isconsidering redistributing Borg-Warner's assets to a number ofsubsdiaries of an entity it created to carry out the merger.    All in all Merrill Lynch estimated that there would be 130mln dlrs in fees and expenses connected with the deal.    Another 250 mln dlrs will be needed to repay certain debtof Borg-Warner, Merrill Lynch said.    To finance the deal, Merrill Lynch said it expects toborrow 3.5 billion dlrs from a group of banks and sell 100 mlndlrs of common stock of the new company, sell 100 mln dlrs ofnon-voting preferred stock of the new company to Merrill Lynchand Co, sell up to 650 mln dlrs of subordinated notes toMerrill Lynch and Co and sell to the public 204 mln dlrs ofsubordinated discount debentures.

"acq,","usa,",SEC SAYS CAMPEAU UNIT VIOLATED DISCLOSURE RULES,"The Securities and ExchangeCommission charged Allied Stores Corp with failing to promptlydisclose key steps it was taking last September to thwart atakeover attempt by Campeau Corp.    In an administrative complaint, the SEC said Allied and itslegal adviser failed to promptly inform shareholders and theagency that it had begun talks with Youngstown, Ohio, shoppingcenter developer Edward DeBartolo in response to Campeau'stakeover offer.    Campeau acquired Allied for an estimated 4.2 billion dlrson Jan 1, following a battle with DeBartolo.    On Sept 25, a day after Allied disclosed that its board hadurged rejection of Campeau's Sept 12 tender offer for 58 dlrs ashare, Allied began negotiating the sale of six shoppingcenters to DeBartolo, the SEC said.    Allied legal advisor and director George Kern, who headsthe merger and acquisitions group at the New York law firm ofSullivan and Cromwell, decided against amending Allied's SECfiling to disclose the talks even though they had resulted insales price of 405 mln dlrs for the shopping centers, it said.    Securities law requires takeover target companies topromptly disclose such things as the sale of major assets.    The day after Campeau increased its tender offer to 80 pctof Allied's stock from 55 pct and raised its bid to 66 dlrs ashare from 58 dlrs on Sept 29, Allied and a partnership headedby DeBartolo began negotiating a takeover deal aimed atthwarting Campeau, the SEC said.    Kern again decided against disclosing the talks in anamended SEC filing, the agency charged.    Allied's first disclosure of the DeBartolo takeover wasmade on Oct 8, even though its board approved the merger on Oct3 and the merger agreement was executed on Oct 7, the complaintsaid.    DeBartolo and Campeau later engaged in a bitter battle forcontrol of Allied, with Campeau winning out later in Octoberwhen it bought a block of 25.8 mln shares of Allied stock, or48 pct of the total, in a controversial move made only minutesafter it dropped its hostile tender offer.    The acquisition of the additional 48 pct, which a federaljudge allowed to be completed, gave Campeau a majority stake inAllied. Campeau bought the rest at 69 dlrs a share.    The SEC said it had planned to file a court brief joiningwith Allied in charging that Campeau had engaged in an illegaltender offer.    But the SEC brief was never filed since the case wasdropped following an agreement between Campeau and DeBartolo.    In the administrative proceeding against Allied and Kern,the SEC is asking for an administrative order that they complywith reporting provisions of securities laws in the future.    Although Allied is no longer publicly traded since itbecame a subsidiary of Campeau, it still files annual andquarterly reports to the SEC because it has outstanding debt. Reuter",1,11

Gerold Tandler, General Secretary of the Christian SocialUnion Party, detailing the cuts at a news conference alsoattended by officials from the Christian Democratic Union andFree Democratic Party, said all of the additional 5.2 billionmark reduction would represent net tax relief.    An increase in revenue from other sources was not planned.    The reductions will be added on to a package of tax cutsalready planned for 1988 amounting to some nine billion marks.    Tandler said three billion marks of the extra tax reliefwould be accounted for by reducing the rate of marginalincrease in income tax.    An increase in personal tax allowances would save taxpayers1.4 billion marks. Extra tax allowances for people whosechildren are being educated would cut 300 mln marks from thetax bill. A further 500 mln marks would be accounted for byincreasing the level of special depreciations for small- andmedium-sized companies.    The extra fiscal measures planned for next year are part ofa general reform of the tax system which will come into effectin 1990. Stoltenberg had said in Paris that part of thisreform, which will cut taxes by a gross 44 billion marks, wouldbe introduced next year, ahead of schedule.    The West German government had come under pressure from theUnited States to stimulate its economy with tax cuts. ButStoltenberg said in a speech last night in Hamburg that, whilethe economy would continue to expand this year, the rate ofgrowth was uncertain.    The government said in January it was aiming for realgrowth in Gross National Product this year of 2.5 pct, but someeconomists have revised their predictions down to two or below.

But rates were expected to rise toward the end of the week.    A major tax payment period by banks on behalf of customers,payments for the federal railways loan stock and repayments ofmark liabilities incurred by foreign central banks with theBundesbank in the framework of the European Monetary System(EMS) are likely to significantly burden the system. Banksbuilt up minimum reserves today, ahead of the expected outflow.    The Bundesbank credited banks with a gross 15.2 billionmarks, but some 8.5 billion left the system at the same time asan earlier securities repurchase pact matured.    Dealers estimated the EMS related outflow as high as sixbillion marks.    The Bundesbank declined to comment, but a spokesman saidyesterday although the funds now due may be allowed to rollover, the possibility that other central banks may choose toredeem them meant a net infusion was needed.    Dealers forecast tax payments of 25 and 30 billion marks,but much of it is expected to burden the system only next week.    Banks' minimum reserve holdings at the Bundesbank totalled53.6 billion marks on Monday, averaging 54.0 billion over thefirst nine days of March.    Dealers said although the figure was well above an expectedrequirement of around 51 billion marks, the expected outflow offunds was so large that banks might find it difficult to meetthe requirement toward the end of March.    No securities repurchase agreement is expiring next week,but dealers said the Bundesbank could offer fresh liquidity ifconditions significantly tighten.

The walkout by Brazil's 40,000 seamen has idled 160 shipsin various ports, Jorge Luis Leao Franco, a senior official ofthe National Merchant Marine Union, told Reuters.

The lower sales were due to the fall in the dollar andother currencies against the mark. Other factors were pressureon selling prices because of a sharp fall in the prices ofcrude oil and petrochemical raw materials and the sale ofpolystyrene business in the U.S. And Netherlands.    World group pretax profit rose to 3.21 billion marks in1986 from 3.16 billion in 1985, with sales falling to 38.01billion from 42.72 billion.    Within group turnover, foreign sales fell to 27.18 billionmarks in 1986 from 31.92 billion in 1985, a drop of 14.9 pct.    The statement made no mention of net profit figures.Hoechst will announce its dividend proposal on April 23.    In the first quarter of this year sales were hit by thecold weather at the start of the year. If the dollar continuesat present low levels, 1987 sales will again be below theprevious year, although in volume terms they are unchanged from1986, Hoechst said.    Sales of paints and dyes, fibres, sheeting and informationtechnology all rose in 1986 but plant construction sales fell.    Hoechst attributed its good results to the performance ofthe parent company, other units in West Germany, and to<American Hoechst Corp>.    Improved earnings in the U.S. Largely reflected therestructuring of styrene and polystyrene activities.    Roussel Uclaf <RUCF.PA> and most domestic non-consolidatedpartners did not perform as well as in 1985.    Hoechst attributed the 12 pct rise in parent company pretaxprofits to 1.82 billion marks above all to a rise in earningsfrom interest and holdings in other companies, and a fall inextraordinary costs.    The fall in raw material prices was not enough tocompensate for the decline in turnover due to lower prices andcurrencies, Hoechst said.    The bulk of the 2.53 billion marks investment in newprojects, up from 294 mln marks in 1985, went on the capitalincrease of Hoechst Capital Corp in connection with theacquisition of <Celanese Corp>.

Marc Mathieu of <Societe Anonyme de Telecommunications>SAT, told journalists the bid foresaw a direct stake of 20 pctfor APT, the joint firm set up by the U.S.'s ATT <T.N.> and theNV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken <PGLO.AS>.    The other 80 pct would be owned by a holding company madeup of SAT, APT, Cie du Midi <MCDP.PA> and five mutual funds.   Under French law, foreign investors are restricted to a 20pct direct stake in privatised companies but can boost theirstake to 40 pct through indirect holdings.    The make-up of the holding company, however, is subject toclose discussions within the government due to legal queriesover the nationality of the mutual funds, a Finance Ministryofficial said.    Although bought by French citizens they are managed byforeign banks <Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York> and<Banque de Neuflize, Schlumberger, Mallet SA>, controlled byAlgemene Bank Nederland NV <ABNN.AS>, an SAT spokesman said.    CGCT, which controls 16 pct of the French public telephoneswitching market, is to be sold by the government for 500 mlnfrancs by private tender.    Five groups are bidding for the company and the governmenthas said it will choose CGCT's new owner by the end of April.    APT vice-president Wim Huisman told a news conference acapital increase was envisaged if SAT-APT wins CGCT, butdeclined to give details or say how an increase would affectforeign stakes in CGCT.    In 1985, CGCT posted losses of 200 mln francs on sales ofthree billion after 1984 losses of 997 mln francs.    A joint SAT-APT statement added that buyers were committedto investing 240 mln francs in CGCT research and productionplants. The APT-SAT offer includes a provision for CGCT toproduce APT 5ESS-PRX switching technology and adapt it toFrench standards.    The tender was launched after a 1985 draft agreement forATT to take over CGCT was abandoned following the introductionof the French government privatisation laws which reopenedbidding among a wider range of applicants.

Company chairman Gerrit van Driel told journalists at thepresentation of Wessanen's 1986 report he already expected 1987first quarter profits to show an increase.    The company last month reported a 16 pct increase in 1986net profits to 72.7 mln guilders, after 62.3 mln in 1985.    This was achieved despite a 25 pct drop in the dollar'sguilder value, van Driel said.    Van Driel said profits would have been nine mln guildershigher if the US currency had remained at its average 1985level of 3.20 guilders.    Turnover, at 3.7 billion guilders in 1986, was 450 mlnguilders down because of the lower dollar and lower rawmaterial prices. Total 1985 turnover was 4.2 billion guilders.    US activities accounted for 34 pct of 1986 turnover,compared with 22 pct in 1982. Wessanen now has 15 separatebusinesses in the US out of a total of 62 world-wide.    Van Driel said the company would continue an activetakeover policy in the US, but would be wary about paying morethan its current price/earnings ratio of 17 times net profit.    He added that Wessanen teams were seeking acquisitionpossibilities in Brazil, Taiwan, Thailand and China.    He said the company had an ample cashflow of 100 mlnguilders and would if necessary make new share issues.    Van Driel said he expected a 1987 US turnover of 700 mlndlrs. He said <Balanced Foods> and <Green's Dairy>, taken overlate last year, have a combined annual turnover of 126 mln dlrswhich was not included in the 1986 account.    All sectors saw strong growth in 1986, resulting in a 13pct increase in operating income to 120 mln guilders. Key tothis growth was the successful introduction of new products,which were greatly enhanced by a number of consumer-oriented USacquisitions, van Driel said.    Consumer products represented 50 pct of total 1986turnover, compared with 35 pct in 1982, van Driel said.    The company, which is already listed on the London, Zurich,Basle and Geneva stock exchanges as well as Amsterdam, aims tobe quoted in Frankfurt and Dusseldorf in May, van Driel said.    Van Driel stressed that while these listings would not beaccompanied by new share issues, they provided easy vehiclesfor the company to raise capital for future expansion.    He estimated that 33 pct of the company's shares were inforeign hands.    The company's 1986 US turnover of about 750 mln dlrs made alisting on one of the New York exchanges a logical next step,van Driel said without elaborating.    Despite EC dairy restrictions Wessanen, which producesaround 10 pct of all Dutch cheese, saw good growth prospectsfor its dairy sector within Europe, van Driel said. REUTER",0,24

The legislation was written in the wake of the May 17thIraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark in the Gulf,which killed 37 Americans, and President Reagan's decision toprotect 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers by putting them under U.S. flags-- effectively making them American ships.    Since the administration made known its reflagging plans,congressional leaders complained they had not been consulted,and some charged the policy could lead the United States intothe 6 1/2-year-old war between Iran and Iraq.    The House was to vote today on a bill -- supported by theDemocratic and Republican congressional leadership and theadministration -- which demanded a report within seven days onplans to meet the security needs of U.S. forces in the gulf.    The resolution was expected to pass without controversytoday in the House Foreign Affairs Committee before the fullHouse was to take up the bill. But in a surprise move, liberalDemocrats and conservative Republicans on the committee joinedin an unusual alliance to oppose the resolution.

The plan is being developed in conjunction with the ECGDand the Bank of England.    Neither the ECGD nor the Bank of England would comment onthe plan. However, bankers said one of the main points underdiscussion is a plan to refinance the bulk of the ECGD's mediumterm credit portfolio in the international capital markets.    The proposals involve introducing a set of interest marginson ECGD backed debt of 5/16 to 7/8 pct, depending on the sizeand maturity of the credit and the currency.    The banks are likely to push for a higher margin. Bankerssaid that while these rates would reduce a bank's return theywould still be more than those proposed about a year ago whenthe government attempted unsuccessfully to initiate anothercost reduction plan.    At the same time, the banks would be expected to allow theECGD to realise additional savings by refinancing existinggovernment backed credit in the capital markets.

In a news conference, the director of the bank's ForeignTrade Department (Cacex), Roberto Fendt, attributed March's weak performance to labour strikes.    March exports totalled 1.43 billion dlrs, against 1.53billion dlrs in February, and 2.16 billion dlrs in March 1986.    March imports amounted to 1.29 billion dlrs compared to1.27 billion dlrs in February and 1.02 billion dlrs in March1986.    Fendt said coffee earnings were up to 220 mln dlrs in Marchfrom 110 mln dlrs in February, while oil derivatives were downto 54 mln dlrs from 58 mln dlrs in February.    He said that although the March results were considerablylower than the same month last year, the government's target ofan eight billion dlr surplus for 1987 should be achieved. TheJanuary-March trade surplus totalled 526 mln dlrs, below thesame period last year, which reached 2.46 billion dlrs.    Asked to explain the reason for his optimism, Fendt saidthe trade surplus should reach one billion dlrs in each of thelast six months of the year.    Even though results in the exports of steel, shoes andfrozen concentrated orange juice were weaker compared toFebruary, Fendt said this was not an indication that the UnitedStates was retaliating on account of its dispute with Brazil inthe issue of informatics.    For the next three months, Fendt estimated a monthly tradesurplus of 400 mln dlrs, for an overall surplus of 1.2 billiondlrs in the April-May-June period. Reuter",3,13

"sugar,","uk,",UK SUGAR FACTORY CLOSES DUE TO SHORTAGE OF BEET,"British Sugar Plc was forced to shut itsIpswich sugar factory on Sunday afternoon due to an acuteshortage of beet supplies, a spokesman said, responding to aReuter inquiry    Beet supplies have dried up at Ipswich due to a combinationof very wet weather, which has prevented most farmers in thefactory's catchment area from harvesting, and last week'shurricane which blocked roads.    The Ipswich factory will remain closed until roads arecleared and supplies of beet build up again.    This is the first time in many years that a factory hasbeen closed in mid-campaign, the spokesman added.    Other factories are continuing to process beet normally,but harvesting remains very difficult in most areas.    Ipswich is one of 13 sugar factories operated by BritishSugar. It processes in excess of 500,000 tonnes of beet a yearout of an annual beet crop of around eight mln tonnes.    Despite the closure of Ipswich and the severe harvestingproblems in other factory areas, British Sugar is maintainingits estimate of sugar production this campaign at around 1.2mln tonnes, white value, against 1.34 mln last year, thespokesman said.    British Sugar processes all sugar beet grown in the U.K.    The sugar beet processing campaign, which began last month,is expected to run until the end of January. Sugar factoriesnormally work 24 hours a day, seven days a week during thecampaign.    As of October 11, 12 pct of the U.K. Sugar crop had beenharvested, little different to the same stage last year when 13pct had been lifted. Since then, however, very wet weather hasseverely restricted beet lifting.    Harvesting figures for the week to October 18 are not yetavailable. Reuter",2,21

The study by the FTC's bureau of economics found that afive dlr a barrel tariff on crude oil and gasoline oil importswould increase costs to consumers by 14 to 16.7 billion dlrs ayear.    After weighing the benefits of such a tariff against thecosts, the study found a five dlr a barrel import fee wouldhave a net cost to the economy of 3.6 billion dlrs a year.    Several oil import fee proposals ranging from two to 10dlrs a barrel have been made in Congress in an effort to cutthe federal budget deficit and maintain the momentum for energyconservation programs, which have been hurt by cheaper oil.    But by making foreign oil more expensive, the tariffs wouldreduce oil imports and force greater consumption of domesticoil, which would deplete U.S. reserves faster, the study found.

In a move to toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws, a keyHouse subcommittee last week approved a toned-down version oflegislation to require President Reagan to retaliate againstforeign countries that follow unfair trade practices.    The bill will be the cornerstone of congressional effortsto restore competitiveness of American industries and turnaround last year's record 169 billion dlrs trade deficit.    Generally, the bill's provisions toughen U.S. enforcementof trade laws.    The trade bill forces the administration to act rapidly oncomplaints of unfair trade practices, such as dumping productsin the United States at prices below cost of production. Italso forces the administration to act rapidly when an industrycomplains that a surge in imports threatens its existence.    In writing the bill, the subcommittee rejected calls fortrade relief for specific industries such as textiles.    Several lawmakers have argued the new trade bill made toomany concessions to Reagan and said they intend to backamendments to get tough"" with countries that violate tradeagreements or keep out U.S. products.

Purolator announced earlier it was mulling atakeover bid, but analysts wrongly predicted the offer was fromanother courier company.    Hutton LBO, a wholly owned subsidiary of E.F. Hutton GroupInc, will be majority owner of the company.    Hutton said the acquiring company, PC Acquisition Inc, ispaying 35 dlrs cash per share for 83 pct of Purolator's stockin a tender offer to begin Thursday. The rest of the shareswill be purchased for securities and warrants to buy stock in asubsidiary of PC Acquisition, containing Purolator's U.S.courier operations.    If all the shares of Purolator are tendered, shareholderswould receive for each share 29 dlrs cash, six dlrs indebentures, and a warrant to buy shares in a subsidiary of PCAcquisition containing the U.S. courier operations.    Hutton said in the merger shareholders would get 46 mlndlrs aggregate amount of guaranteed debentures due 2002 of PCAcquisition and warrants to buy 15 pct of the common stock ofthe PC courier subsidiary. Hutton said the company has valuedthe warrants at two to three dlrs per share.

Purolator retains its Stant division, which makes closurecaps for radiators and gas tanks. A Hutton spokesman said thefirm is reviewing its options on Stant.    Purolator's courier business has been lagging that of itsU.S. rivals because of the high price it paid in the pastseveral years to add air delivery to its ground fleet.    E.F.

Net would have risen 10.1 pct but for the increase incompany tax to 49 pct from 46 and the imposition of the tax onfringe benefits, paid by employers and not the recipients, thecompany said in a statement.    Fairfax also pointed to the cyclical downturn in revenuegrowth in the television industry as another reason for theflat first half earnings.    It said it considered the result satisfactory in view ofthese factors.    Fairfax said its flagship dailies, The Sydney MorningHerald and the Melbourne Age, boosted advertising volume, asdid the Australian Financial Review, and posted extremelysatisfactory performances. Magazines also performed strongly.    But an 8.9 pct rise in television costs outweighed a 4.0pct rise in revenue, it said.

This accounted for the 89.32 mln dlr extraordinary profit.    Fairfax said it is too early to predict results for thefull year.

Total revenue was eight pct lower in 1986 at 7.97 billionguilders vs 8.7 billion guilders in 1985. The company said itsrevenues were down due to lower foreign exchange rates and achange in accounting practice. It added that revenues wouldhave risen by about seven pct had those changes not occurred.    Revenue from Dutch operations rose five pct in 1986, mainlydue to its life insurance business.    Health insurance revenues in the Netherlands also rosedespite a notable shift to insurances with lower premiums andhigher personal risks.    Damage insurances made losses, mainly due to car damageinsurances. AEGON did not specify the loss.    In the United States, revenue in guilders from health andlife insurance was lower. AEGON said this was due to a changein accounting for U.S. Annuities.    AEGON said annuities are subject to such strong personalinvestment influences that it should be accounted differentlyfrom the more traditional insurances.    This change in accounting practice and another change toaccount for profits made on fixed interest investments,resulted in an incidental rise in net profits of 31 mlnguilders.    AEGON said incidental negative influences on net profitswere slightly higher, being the lower dollar rate, high initialcosts for new products, and the cost of new headquarters in TheHague.    In 1986, a large number of new insurance products emergedin the Netherlands and the U.S., AEGON said. Large initialcosts for these products have depressed net profits somewhat.    Monumental Corp, a U.S. Insurer which merged with AEGON inMay 1986, saw its profits almost completely eroded by thesecosts and made only a small contribution to the group'sprofits.    AEGON said it has written-off 657 mln guilders in goodwillfor Monumental Corp.    AEGON's net equity was 2.71 billion guilders in December1986, against 3.46 billion the year before.  REUTER",0,24

"gold,","usa,",THREE U.S. EXCHANGES VIE FOR GOLD,"The glitter of gold has generated athree-way competition among the world's largest futuresexchanges for a 100-ounce contract for the precious metal.    When the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) re-introducesgold futures trading here Tuesday (at 9 a.m. CDT), it will gotoe-to-toe in an uphill battle against the Commodity ExchangeInc. of New York (Comex), which brokerage executives describeas the world's precious metals futures capital forinstitutional business.    And by autumn, the oldest and biggest exchange, the ChicagoBoard of Trade (CBT), expects to join the fray when theCommodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) approves a pendingapplication for a 100-ounce gold contract to trade side-by-sidewith the CBT's smaller, one kilogram (about 2.5 U.S. pounds)gold futures.    The CME introduced a 100-ounce gold futures contract in1974, but lack of interest forced it to abandon the instrumentin July 1986.    CME officials said investors and brokerage firms asked theexchange to reintroduce the contract because of recentvolatility in precious metals. Other factors influencing thedecision may also have been clearing problems in May whichforced the Comex to shorten trading for three straight days inan effort to clear up a huge backlog of unresolved trades,especially in silver futures.    Comex's problems may now create a window of opportunity forother exchanges to successfully offer precious metalscontracts, industry sources say.    But it is much too early to predict whether other exchangescan inflict serious damage on the Comex' daily trading volumeof more than 40,000 contracts which represents commitments tobuy and sell gold of more than 2 billion dlrs.    While average daily trading in the CBT's smaller goldcontract, aimed at retail customers rather than institutions,was under 500 contracts per day throughout 1986, it hassurpassed 1,000 contracts daily for the past two months.

The Bay Area Council, a group of more than 300 businessfirms, said that a study of corporate restructuring in anine-county area found that San Francisco itself had sufferedsome ill effects from corporate shake-ups but that surroundingcommunities had not.    Seventeen of the 32 Fortune 500 companies in the area leftdue to corporate restructuring between 1979 and 1986, butanother 21 firms were added to the list.    Ten of the departing companies were based in San Francisco.During the period, only six located in the city achievedFortune 500 status.    Ted Hall, a council director and local managing director ofMcKinsey and Co. which conducted the survey, said the studygrew out of concern that mergers and acquisitions had seriouslyhurt the economic climate of northern California.    However, Hall said that only about 36,000 jobs had beenlost in the region, while more than 600,000 new jobs werecreated during the period.    At the same time, he said, the region experienced a greaterrise in per capita income and lower unemployment than the restof the United States and California.

Lukman, who was speaking during talks with Swedish tradeofficials, said the stable price depended upon output restraintby both OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers, Swedish governmentofficials said.    They said Lukman, who is also Nigerian oil minister, madethe remarks whilst talking about the connection between ThirdWorld debt and industrialised nations.    Crude oil output controls did not necessarily mean higherenergy bills for the world's industrial nations, Lukman said.    Although very low oil prices, such as those seen around thebeginning of the year, may appear beneficial for the industrialcountries that depend on imported energy, they would only leadto wastage and overdependence on the fuel in the long term, hesaid.

The Bundesbank set a target range of three to six pctgrowth from fourth quarter 1986 to fourth quarter 1987 forcentral bank money stock. In the previous year it grew 7.7 pct,outside the 3-1/2 to 5-1/2 pct target range.    The Bundesbank noted that monetary policy in 1986 waslimited by a series of external factors.    These included the revaluation of the mark, growing foreignpayments surpluses of non-banks, and currency inflows.    The Bundesbank therefore tolerated the monetary overshootin 1986, as an attempt to counter monetary expansion withinterest rate and liquidity moves would have increased upwardpressure on the mark, it said.    The lower end of the 1987 target range would be realisticif a large part of funds currently held in a liquid form wereinvested in long-term bank accounts or bonds, public bonds orforeign securities, the Bundesbank said.    But if companies and private households continue to holdtheir funds in liquid forms, or if there are further currencyinflows, growth will be closer to the upper end of the range.    The more the conflict between external constraints anddomestic objectives relaxes -- and many things point to this atthe time of writing this report -- the more possible it will beto do justice again to the medium-term concept of money supplycontrol",4,23

Internal demand is now forecast to rise four pct against aprevious target of 3.5 pct.    Mariano Rubio, governor of the Bank of Spain, the centralbank, yesterday said internal demand was currently growing atan annual rate of six pct and it had to be brought down to fourpct if the government were to meet its five pct inflationtarget this year. Inflation was 8.3 pct in 1986.    The forecast for private consumption growth remainsunchanged at three pct, although public consumption is revisedupwards to 2.5 pct from 2.0 pct.    Growth in domestic demand will fuel imports, expected toincrease by 8.6 pct against an originally estimated 7.1 pct.    Export growth has been revised downwards to 3.7 pct from5.2 pct due to the peseta's continuing strength against thedollar and slack external demand.    Slow growth of exports and a tight rein on state spendinghas lowered estimated GDP growth to three pct in 1987 from anearlier forecast 3.5 pct. GDP grew by three pct last year.    The economy ministry is holding its inflation forecast tofive pct, in spite of minister Carlos Solchaga's doubts lastweek on whether this target could be maintained if wagesettlements continue to rise above the government's recommendedfive pct ceiling.

The mining and smelting group earlier reported 1986 netearnings rose to 138.2 mln dlrs from 87.8 mln in 1985, againstanalysts' forecasts yesterday of 125 mln to160 mln.    CRA said it was deferring consideration of a dividend untillater this year to provide the benefit of dividend imputationto its shareholders. After July 1, dividends will be tax-freeto shareholders provided they come out of earnings on which thefull 49 pct company tax rate has been pid.    The company operates on a substituted tax year, not thefiscal year ending June 30, and as a result has incurred tax atthe 49 pct rate on 1986 earnings, CRA said in a statement.    Consequently, it has funds available for distribution withdividend imputed but is waiting to see the imputationlegislation before determining the final payout, it said.    Despite the higher net earnings, CRA said 1986 was a pooryear for the minerals industry, with the notable exception ofgold producers.    Prices for major metals expressed in real U.S. Dollarsdeclined to the lowest levels in about 50 years, it said.    Fluctuating exchange and interest rates added volatilityand uncertainty, while the revaluation of the yen is leading tosubstantial restructuring of Japanese industry, CRA said.    World demand for metals is growing slowly. Inventories havesteadily declined, with supply and demand in better balance,but overcapacity continues, CRA said.    Turning to contributions to its earnings, CRA saidBougainville Copper Ltd <BUVA.S> contributed 31.3 mln dlrswhile its share of Comalco Ltd's <CMAC.S> net was 37.8 mln.    Net earnings from iron-ore operations were 111.8 mln dlrsagainst 149.2 mln in 1985, it said.    Lead, zinc and silver mining and smelting operationsincurred a net loss of 66.8 mln dlrs against a 38.1 mln loss in1985, CRA said.    Coal activities resulted in a net profit of 36.7 mln dlrsagainst 34.1 mln, while salt raised its contribution to 4.7 mlnfrom 2.8 mln.    CRA's share of earnings from the Argyle diamond projectamounted to 12.0 mln dlrs against nine mln in 1985.    CRA said the main item in its 250.28 mln dlr extraordinaryloss was a 172.9 mln writeoff of unrealised foreign exchangelosses on borrowings as required by a new accounting standard.    Other extraordinary items were 63.3 mln dlrs provided forclosures and writedown of assets and a 14.1 mln increase infuture tax provisions, CRA said.    Cash flow continued at a high level, being 950.6 mln dlrsbefore capital expenditure against 1.02 billion in 1985. Thestrong cash flow, coupled with the proceeds of the 1986 rightsissue and the use of existing cash balances, enabled group debtto be reduced by nearly 500 mln dlrs.

Hazelhoff, speaking at a press conference after the releaseof ABN's 1986 results, said a sharp decrease in foreignearnings had been compensated by a strong domestic performance,notably in the securities business.    He said the bank was also proposing a one for 10share-split which should facilitate trade in the bank's stock.    News of the split sparked a 14 guilder rise in ABN's shareprice on the Amsterdam bourse to a close of 517 guilders.    Prospects for 1987 hung on three uncertainties, namely thefuture trend of the dollar, the level of interest rates andABN's share of equities trade, Hazelhoff said.    Provisions for general contingencies were reduced in 1986by 4.1 pct to 575 mln guilders, while taxes increased by 2.1pct to 242 mln guilders, he added.    Lower global interest rates in 1986 had nipped earningsmargins via traditional lending activities, he said.    Hazelhoff said ABN was unlikely to continue reducing riskprovisions in the future but he noted the bank was not overlyconcerned about default by Latin American debtors, a factorwhich brokers say has distanced Dutch insititutions from bankstocks recently.    He said that of the bank's estimated 25 financiallytroubled sovereign debtors, about one quarter were LatinAmerican countries. These would ultimately pay up, he said.    He added that losses incurred through loans to tinproducers in the wake of the tin council crisis at end-1985 hadbeen written off. REUTER",0,24

"acq,","uk,",BP TO OFFER 7.4 BILLION DLRS FOR STANDARD SHARES,"British Petroleum Co Plc <BP.L> said itintended to make a tender offer for the 45 pct of Standard OilCo <SRD.N> it does not already own at 70 dlrs a share cash, fora total of 7.4 billion if the offer is fully accepted.    The offer would be made through its <BP North America Inc>unit and was intended to commence not later than April 1. Theoffer would not be conditional on any minimum number of sharesbeing tendered.    BP said in a statement the 70 dlr a share price was basedon its own valuation as well as those of its financialadvisers. It took into account reviews of both public andnon-public information.    Standard closed in New York last night at 64-7/8 dlrs, down1-3/4 dlrs.    BP shares dropped on the announcement to 877p from 888p atlast night's close.    About a third of the cash payable would be met from BP'sown resources.    The remainder would come from new borrowings, partly frombanks under a four-year committed revolving credit facility andpartly from a a new U.S. Dlr commercial paper programme. Thecompany said it was in the course of arranging thesefacilities.    BP Chairman Sir Peter Walters said that the group'sinvestment in Standard was its largest single asset. Fullownership would enable investment and operating decisions to bemade without the limitations of a minority interest.    BP also believed the acquisition represented the optimumuse of its financial resources. It was confident oil priceswere likely to remain within a range sufficient to justify theinvestment.    Walters added that it also felt that, due to managementchanges in 1986, Standard could now operate successfully evenin a lower oil price environment.    Standard's net assets at end-1986 were 7.02 billion dlrsand in the year it reported a loss of 1.08 billion dlrs beforetax and before an extraordinary item of 608 mln dlrs.    Analysts said that the move by BP had come as a surprise.One noted that it was not immediately clear why the groupshould spend so much money buying a company it alreadycontrolled.    BP could also have bought up the remainder of Standardshares considerably cheaper had it moved six months ago.    It was also unclear what effect the tender would have onthe U.K. Government's recent announcement that it intended todispose of its remaining 31.7 pct stake in BP sometime in the1987/88 financial year, analysts said.    Analyst Paul Spedding of brokers Kleinwort Grieveson notedthat any effect on the government sale of its stake in BP woulddepend on the reaction of the markets.    The deal would probably push BP's gearing up to around 59pct from 20 pct currently, he said.    However, with the likelihood that oil prices would notrepeat last year's rapid drop the prospects for Standardreturning to profitability this year -- and BP benefitting fromits cash flow -- were good.    Standard was a high cost oil producer, the analysts noted.    Spedding noted that it needed about 12 dlrs a barrel tomake money, and at about 15 dlrs a barrel revenue fromproduction and its downstream activities would push itcomfortably into surplus.    BP initially took a stake in Standard following thediscovery of oil in Alaska's Prudhoe bay in 1969. BP hadinadequate distribution facilities in the U.S. While Standard,which was strong on marketing and refining, was short on crudeoil.    The analysts said that BP had promoted a major managementreorganisation of Standard in the past year.    The probability that much of the shake-up at Standard wasnow complete was one possible factor behind the timing of thetender offer, Spedding said.    BP's willingness to take hard decisions such as majorbalance sheet write offs and the sale of assets had been wellreceived in the markets.    The lower costs that should now be possible -- especiallyafter the rationalisation of the loss making minerals division-- should allow the benefits of an oil price recovery to comestraight through to 1987 profits without being cut back byother sectors.

"acq,","usa,",NEW LEADER COMING TO U.S. SEC IN CHALLENGING ERA,"President Reagan's nominee as toppoliceman for the nation's securities markets will inherit anagency challenged by an insider trading scandal, wild stockprice gyrations and a host of uncertainties stemming from theglobalization of financial markets.    David Ruder, a 58-year-old Republican law professor atNorthwestern University in Evanston, Ill., was named Thursdayto be the 23rd chairman of the five-member U.S. Securities andExchange Commission.    If confirmed by the Senate, as expected, he will succeedJohn Shad, who left the agency earlier this week after a recordsix years as chairman to become ambassador to the Netherlands.    The SEC has been in the limelight for the past year as itsinvestigators have probed into the most colossal insidertrading scandal ever uncovered on Wall Street.    The investigation, which is still active, mushroomed inrecent months as a growing number of well known traders andprominent investment banking firms have been charged withwrongdoing.    The pace of the probe picked up markedly in November afterIvan Boesky, one of Wall Street's most successful stockspeculators, agreed to cooperate with government investigatorsand to pay a record 100 mln dlrs in penalties and illegalprofits after being charged with insider trading.    But the agency is also wrestling with a vexing newphenomenon of huge and rapid swings in stock prices, spurred bycomputer-driven trading strategies that span markets in securities, options and futures. The price gyrations havecombined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedentedvolatility to some U.S. securities markets.    At the same time, the SEC is being pressed by somelawmakers to put a stop to abusive tactics in corporatetakeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeoverssteadily reshapes the U.S. corporate landscape.    And the agency is being pushed by U.S. and foreignexchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundworkfor an international securities marketplace in which tradingoccurs across borders throughout the world, around the clock.    Such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investmentopportunities but could strain the SEC's ability to enforceU.S. securities laws and guard investors from fraud.    Under the leadership of Shad, the SEC eased financialdisclosure requirements for publicly traded companies,eliminated many minor investor protection rules, attempted tospur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agency'sreview of hostile corporate takeovers.    Shad, who had been vice chairman of the E. F. Huttoninvestment banking firm, brought a Wall Street perspective tothe agency upon being named chairman in 1981.    In line with the views of other top administrationofficials, he favored marketplace determination of takeoverbattles over new federal regulations.    The SEC under Shad also stressed prosecution of insidertrading violations over the corporate wrongdoing cases thattopped the agency's enforcement agenda during theadministration of President Jimmy Carter, a Democrat.    Securities lawyers and industry officials acquainted withRuder say the new chairman-designate is unlikely tosignificantly alter the commission's current priorities.    The SEC currently has about 2,000 employees, most of themlawyers, and an annual budget of about 115 mln dlrs though thatfigure likely will be significantly higher next year as theagency moves to beef up its enforcement staff.    The agency is one of the few in the government thatactually has taken in more money than it has spent in the pastfew years because of fees it charges public companies,investment banks and other securities firms it regulates.    The SEC is structured as an independent regulatory agency,meaning that its five commissioners are appointed by thepresident to fixed five-year terms and protected from firingfor policy differences alone.    By law, no more than three commissioners may be of the samepolitical party, and the agency prepares its own budget requesteach year instead of leaving this to the White House.    Established by Congress in 1934, the SEC traces its originsto the great stock market crash of 1929, which was attributedin large part to widespread trading on credit and attemptedmarket manipulations by large investment firms.    The agency requires public companies and investmentvehicles such as mutual funds to issue periodic reports ontheir financial condition and to disclose changes in theircondition any time they issue new securities.    It requires brokers, dealers and investment banks toregister with it and comply with investor protection rules, andit polices exchanges and regulates trading practices.    Its first chairman was Joseph Kennedy, an industrialmagnate who was also the father of John Kennedy, later tobecome the nation's 35th president.    Other former chairmen include William Douglas, who servedfrom 1937 until his appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court in1939, and William Casey, who served during President Nixon'sfirst term and was Reagan's director of the CentralIntelligence Agency until his death earlier this year.

Overall, Carter predicted beet plantings would rise in themidwest, and this coupled with increases in California wouldincrease U.S. sugarbeet plantings slightly from the 1.232 mlnacres sown last year.    USDA later today releases its first estimate of 1987 U.S.sugarbeet plantings in the prospective plantings report.    The main reason for the expected increase in beet sowingsis that returns from competing crops such as soybeans andgrains are just awful",2,11

They told Reuters they expect the firm to show earnings ofbetween 420 mln and 450 mln H.K. Dlrs last year against 157 mlnin 1985.    The analysts also said they expect Jardine Matheson to paya total dividend of 15 to 20 cents a share against 10 cents ashare in 1985.    James Capel (Far East) Ltd estimates Jardine Matheson's1986 profits at 450 mln dlrs and attributes most of the incometo retail sales.    Analysts said the group's 7-Eleven retail stores and itsfranchises, among them Canon cameras, Christian Dior luxurygoods and Mercedes Benz cars, produced a strong cash flow.    Alan Hargreaves of Hoare Govett Asia Ltd also put JardineMatheson's 1986 net profits at 450 mln dlrs and said heestimates pre-tax earnings from retail operations at about 465mln dlrs against 339 mln in 1985.    But Hargreaves said Jardine Matheson's earnings from its 35pct stake in Hong Kong Land Co Ltd <HKLD.HKG> will fall toabout 230 mln dlrs from 281 mln dlrs in 1985.    The reduced contribution reflects the spin-off from HongKong Land of <Dairy Farm International Ltd> last September.    Jardine gained a direct holding of 35 pct of Dairy Farm asa result of the spin-off. Analysts said Jardine will bookrevenues from its Dairy Farm stake for the final months of theyear as part of its retail business, which will increase itsoverall retail income figures.    Analysts said Jardine Matheson will also enjoy sharplyincreased revenues from financial services, mainly its 50 pctshare of <Jardine Fleming Holdings Ltd>.    Jardine Fleming yesterday reported record profits for 1986of 209.5 mln dlrs against 104.7 mln in 1985.    Analysts said Jardine Matheson made net interest paymentsof about 200 mln dlrs last year, slightly below the 213 mlndlrs of 1985, while the company's term debt remained at aboutthe 1985 level of 2.7 billion dlrs.    But Jardine was also subject to increased taxes of 340 mlndlrs last year against 292 mln in 1985, they said.    Jardine Matheson is undergoing a series of reorganisationsthat will in effect turn it into a holding company for itsdiverse interests.    It previously announced a plan to sell its stakes in bothHong Kong Land and Dairy Farm to newly created <JardineStrategic Holdings Ltd> in which it has a 41 pct interest.    A company statement issued last month said the firm willuse the proceeds to repay all debt, leaving it with anadditional 500 mln dlrs in cash on hand.    Though Jardine Matheson will be deprived of a direct stakein the high-yield Hong Kong Land and Dairy Farm units, it islikely to develop its own business, analysts said.

Evans was referring to a nearly completed government reviewof oil taxation.    Evans said there were plenty of examples where targetedapproaches to oil industry taxation had produced good resultsin recent years.    These include the reduction in the top marginal crudeexcise rate on 'old' Bass Strait oil found before September1975 to 80 pct from 87 pct, and the waiver of excise on onshoreoil announced last September, he said.    The industry, through the APEA, has been calling for theelimination of secondary taxation on oil in order to boostincentives for prospecting against a background of weak pricesand Australia's relatively low exploration levels.

The SEC issued a formal order launching the privateinvestigation on Nov 12, 1986, Icahn said in the SEC filing.    The order empowers SEC investigators to try to find outwhether any persons, including Icahn, violated securities lawsand related rules, Icahn said.    Specifically, the probe is examining the acquisition andsubsequent sale of more than five pct of the stock of certainunspecified companies, he said.    Federal law requires individuals or groups of individualswho have made shareholder agreements, to disclose stakes incompanies of at least five pct within 10 days.    Icahn has acknowledged that he has been subpoenaed inconnection with SEC probes, but this is the first time he hasdisclosed that he is among those being investigated.    By making the disclosure in a filing with the SEC, which isobviously already aware of its own probe, Icahn was alsoalerting current and potential shareholders of TWA.    It is not uncommon for companies which are aware that theyor their officers are the targets of government probes toacknowledge the existence of the otherwise secretinvestigations to fulfill their legal disclosure requirementsto their shareholders.    Icahn said the SEC is looking into whether he and otherswhom he did not name violated securities laws by acquiring andselling more than five pct of a company's stock.    SEC investigations into those kinds of possible securitieslaw violations have been spawned by the agency's widening probeinto the Wall Street insider trading scandal, according topublished reports.

Strenger, management board chairman of Bayer AG <BAYG.F>,told a news conference at the Hanover trade fair the maindangers were stagnation in world trade, the lower dollar aswell as crude oil and commodity prices.    Prospects of higher operating costs were also seen harmingearnings, he said. Turnover took a considerable downturn at thestart of 1987 after falling 5.9 pct in 1986.    The chemical industry, which relies heavily on exports, wasbadly hit by mark appreciation in 1986 and lower turnover wasmainly due to foreign exchange losses, Strenger said.    Exports fell 6.4 pct to 72 billion marks in 1986 andcompetition from U.S. And British firms increased. Savings fromlower oil and commodity prices were eaten up by pricecompetition and increased costs.    Strenger said 1986 operating profits of German chemicalfirms were slightly worse than the year before but the improvedfinancial and balance sheet structure, after three good years,neutralized the negative impact.    Strenger said the industry would try to increase productionin the U.S. To make up for lost export possibilities out ofWest Germany.    The lower dollar was the main reason for an 8.3 pct fall inexports to North America, an 11.4 pct drop to Latin America and22.6 pct plunge to the Middle East.    Exports to Western Europe eased 3.5 pct and Far Eastexports, due to an economic revival in Japan, dropped 5.2 pct.    Strenger noted that the industry had lost public confidencefollowing several cases of chemical pollution of the Rhine latelast year. REUTER",0,23

"sugar,","france,",BEGHIN-SAY NOT PLANNING TO WITHDRAW SUGAR,"French sugar producer Beghin-Say is notcurrently planning to withdraw the sugar it has placed intointervention, despite the exceptionally high rebate awarded atthis week's European Community (EC) sugar tender, Beghin-SayPresident Jean-Marc Vernes told Reuters.    The maximum rebate of 46.864 Ecus per 100 kilos onWednesday was the largest ever granted, according to traders.    Vernes said he was satisfied the European Commission hasstarted to move in the right direction, but said his companyhad no plans to change its decision to put sugar intointervention.    But Vernes said he hoped that in the next few weeks a finalagreement would be reached with the commission which wouldallow operators to withdraw the sugar from intervention.    European operators offered 854,000 tonnes of sugar intointervention to protest about export rebates which they say aretoo low. Over 785,000 tonnes of this sugar was accepted by thecommission on Wednesday, according to commission sources.    Under EC regulations, however, operators have another fourto five weeks to withdraw the sugar from intervention beforepayment is made for it.    A total of 706,470 tonnes of French sugar and 79,000 tonnesof West German sugar has been accepted into intervention, tradesources said here. This amount represents about a third ofannual EC exports to non-EC countries.    Beghin-Say declined to specify the amount of sugar it hadoffered into intervention, but said it was below 500,000tonnes.    Producers say they have been losing 2.5 to 3.0 Ecus onevery 100 kilos exported due to the failure of rebates to fullybridge the gap between EC and world prices. Wednesday's rebatewas 0.87 Ecus short of what producers say is needed to get anequivalent price to that for sales into intervention, traderssaid.    Vernes said operators hope to get a rebate which equates tothe full intervention price and said Wednesday's tender was astep in the right direction.    Sugar producers here said the volume of sugar authorisedfor export since the begining of the current campaign had beeninadequate and that more should be exported now to compensate.    Trade sources said new regulations governing exportrebates, which are due to be adopted shortly, may smooth thepath for the commission to award larger export rebates infuture.    One source at a leading French sugar house said it seemedthe commission had understood the protest action and was nowmoving towards adapting the situation accordingly, therebyallowing the operators to withdraw their sugar fromintervention once they got satisfaction.

The bill passed 305-102 -- winning a necessary two-thirdsof those voting -- despite a last-minute revolt by an allianceof liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans who sought todefeat it as a signal that a growing number of legislatorsoppose President Reagan's policies in the region.    The legislation was passed in the wake of the May 17thIraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark in the Gulf,which killed 37 Americans, and Reagan's decision to protect 11Kuwaiti oil tankers by putting them under U.S. flags --effectively making them American ships.    The legislation -- supported by Congress' Democratic andRepublican leadership as well as by the administration --required Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger to provide areport to Congress, within seven days of enactment, on plans toprotect U.S. warships and flag ships in the Persian Gulf.    It did not, however, place any restrictions on theadministration as it proceeds to reflag the Kuwaiti ships andthus has no immediate effect on U.S. policy.    The Senate was expected to approve the legislation thisweek. The bill would then be sent to Reagan for signature.    Supporters of the bill said passage of the bill was only afirst step toward a greater congressional involvement informulating policy.    But Democratic critics said the bill did not ask theadministration to address tough policy questions in the report. Reuter",5,11
